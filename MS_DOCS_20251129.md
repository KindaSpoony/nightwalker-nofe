# Microsoft Docs Sync – 2025-11-29

The previous update left this document with competing edits. This version resolves the conflict by combining the navigation tweaks with the clarified troubleshooting steps so the daily sync can proceed cleanly.

## Highlights
- Keeps the refreshed table of contents language from the incoming branch.
- Retains the revised troubleshooting bullet points from the local branch.
- Removes duplicate sentences and normalizes headings for consistency.

## Troubleshooting Notes
- Verify image assets render after the sync; stale caches caused missing thumbnails in the prior run.
- When running the docs build locally, clear any `dist/` artifacts before invoking the generator to avoid stale content.
- Confirm that external links are resolved with `npm run lint:links` before publishing to avoid broken references.

## Next Steps
With the conflicts resolved, re-run the docs update job so the pipeline can pick up this file without manual intervention.
