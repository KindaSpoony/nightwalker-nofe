Found three weeks later, the 23-year-old died on the way to hospital.

**Summary:** Member states back Correct the Map campaign that urges governments and organisations to use more accurate map The African Union has backed a campaign to end the use by governments and international organisations of the 16th-century Mercator map of the world in favour of one that more accurately displays Africa’s size.
