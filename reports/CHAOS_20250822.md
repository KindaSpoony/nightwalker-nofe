"It is a famine: the Gaza famine," said Tom Fletcher, the UN's emergency relief coordinator. He blamed Israel, accusing it of "systematic obstruction" of aid deliveries to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory. Israel's foreign ministry said the declaration that famine is now present in and around Gaza City was "based on Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests".

The recognition of Palestine is more likely to come at the end of such a process and such decisions would now be rather counterproductive," the spokesperson said during a press conference.
